What is the best feature at Disney MGM?Together with Indiana Jones is Star Tours, the great simulator of Star Wars. You are in a strange fusion of bus and spaceship.The cool thing is that the simulator is very realistic and loyal to Star Wars Saga, so you can sense a great speed when you enter Hyperspace or when you are evading laser shots at the Death Star. The "bus" is controlled by R2 and a droid called RX-1138, or just Rex, a troublesome droid who makes many mistakes during the film, like entering an ice asteroid. But afteralls, Star Tours is perfect, just like Star Wars!<br /><br />10!
[MAY BE SPOILERS]<br /><br /> Whenever I visit Disneyland, the very first ride I go on is this one! It is the coolest! The best ride in the whole park. I must ride it about five times. I never get tired of it! I love watching C-3PO and R2-D2 always repairing the Star Speeder 3000 while the screen advertises trips to Endor to visit Ewoks or a ski vacation on Hoth, or perhaps a wild adventure on Tatooine. It's so cool to see C-3PO and R2-D2 up close! You feel like those who have been in the movies. Then you board the ship. Your captain: RX Droid named Rex. The start of the flight is bumpy because he steers the ship right into the maintenence bay, then he zooms right past the Endor moon and right into a comet field. When that has passed, we run into the Empire! Then we help the rebellion blow the Death Star into oblivion then arrive safely at our destination.<br /><br /> Again, the coolest ride at Disneyland! I hope they never touch it to fit those prequels. It's fine the way it is! So in conclusion, if you haven't ridden this ride before then my God, ride it! Immediately! You will love it! I guarantee it!! You'll wanna go get in line again when the ride's over! We all know the lines at Disneyland are murder but there are plenty of cool things to see while waiting. So please, ride this ride ASAP! You won't regret it! And may the Force be with you!<br /><br />-
My father and I were in Disneyland 1 week prior to the "Grand Opening" of this ride at Disneyland back in 1987. Needless to say it is still on our list to catch when at the Disney parks. Considering the technology at the time it came out, it is still the foundation by which other "sim" rides attempt to duplicate. It was a lot of fun and regardless of the dialogue, it is just a good time...
This ride was made in 1987, and therefore is based entirely on the original Trilogy. Anyone who expects anything from the much later added first three episodes obviously can't be very bright. This ride was WAY ahead of its time when it was new, and is still a great ride and lots of fun.<br /><br />As to why there would be no Jedi Knight, Sith Lord or light saber fight, well, this ride is called "Star TOURS." The entire gist of the ride is that you are on a space tour bus. R2D2 is co-pilot, and many of the other original Star Wars characters are throughout the ride which includes the waiting area.<br /><br />REX basically takes the passengers of his ship on a trip around the Death Star almost exactly identical to that of Luke Skywalker in the first Star Wars movie. Anyone who doesn't get that, obviously can't be that big of a Star Wars fan, although you definitely don't need to be a Star Wars fan to enjoy this simlulator.
It has been years since my experience but it is still a vivid memory. Judging this movie solely on the film, there are excellent graphics and it tells a story that makes you belive you are actually involved in the film. The ride simply adds to this story and make it an "attraction."
You will enjoy this motion simulator ride a lot more if you have seen or are a fan of the Star Wars movies. There's not a lot of you, but I did ride this before I saw the films. I enjoyed it then as well. There are better motion simulator rides out there, but this one probably came first.
This ride sucks. I love Star Wars and there is no Star Wars character in this one. It is mediocre when compared to other simulators like Back to the future and Spiderman.<br /><br />Star Wars deserved a better ride. I still can't believe they have created a Star Wars ride without a single Jedi Knight, Sith Lord or light saber fight.
You know t's such a shame that neither of these films went wide release. Sure they needed a little touching up in some places but these films are definate quality material. A breathe of fresh air in the horror films which is recreating itself once again as a truly important genre. Both of these films are good, and borderline great. they take somewhat sillacious storylines and make them somewhat believable filled with aggreassive dark humor and independent film dread. This sequel is pretty much a direct continuation of the original. It leaves the last films heroine Bridget infected and fighting her illness with the cure found in the last film. She's beginning to change when she's taken in by a youth facility and locked up for drug abuse. What insues is unfortunatly unwelcome and senseless visits from the first films title charachter but a vast mixing pool of other cringe inducing twists including the fact that a male werewolf has found her and wants to mate. A sleezy hospital guard who trades sexual favors for drugs. An innocent little girl obsessed with comic books. I wish I could truly give away the ending to you. Because it was so well done and I just didnt see it coming. And that is what this film prides itself on unpredictability. It goes in a completely opposite direction of where you though it was going and it makes sense. All in all the film has much to be successful with believable performances, especially from the film's lead Bridget, a good storyline, suspenseful direction, a creepy score all adding up to a startling refreshing take on an otherwise dying genre. Don't be fooled this sequel has major bite!
This is an enjoyable and surprisingly competent DTV follow up to cult hit Ginger Snaps. The first film was dark, entertaining and witty and had a good amount of tension and scares. The sequel is good fun but lacks the wit of the original and a certain amount of the hip-ness. The lack of Ginger herself is also evident. Katherine Isabelle is back but essentially in a cameo as the ghost of Ginger while once again the angst ridden sister Bridget is the centre of the story. Following the events of the first film, Bridget is on the run, moving from town to town and constantly taking monkshood (the drug that prevents werewolfism) to stop her turning into a werewolf following the final confrontation in the first film. When she is found overdosing on the stuff she falls into a coma and wakes up in a mental hospital but soon she is tracked down by another werewolf and with no monkshood to slow down her own transformation she must fight her impending hairiness. As she has found, Monkshood doesn't prevent Wolfiness, only slows the transformation. At the institute she meets the eccentric Ghost, who is fascinated with Bridget and soon learns of her problem. When a residents of the institute start turning up dead Ghost initially suspects Bridget but they soon discover that a mate is tracking Bridget to make hairy werewolf babies with her. As well as this Ghost may not be quite as she seems. This is well shot and has some tense moments and considering its small budget it is a remarkably accomplished and enjoyable piece of work. A good and more low key Ginger Snaps movie it is. ***
Brigitte now has the virus in her blood that destroyed her sister Ginger in the first film. So to prevent herself from changing into the beast she injects monksblood into her system, but after an overdose she wakes up in a rehabilitation clinic. Which now she has become so attached to the syrup and without it, the affects of the curse starts to transform within her. From the physical to the mental attributes. But also on her tail is that of a male werewolf who wants to mate with her and Ginger is keeping a tab on her by haunting her mind. <br /><br />I remember when I picked up 'Ginger Snaps' I was expecting another mediocre or below-average werewolf flick. Gosh, I was wrong! Just like 'Dog Soldiers' it was more then good and added some new life to the whimpering sub-genre. And I'm happy to say it worked out again in this monstrous sequel and I was actually digging this one a tad more, though that was up until the stalling sequences involving hiding out in a house. It would've been great to see more Katharine Isabelle as Ginger too, but you can't have it all your own way I guess. I wasn't expecting anything incredibly special, but it did have big boots to fill and we all know the law of diminishing returns. Well, this sequel keeps far away form that trend and doesn't lean away from the quirky and offbeat nature of its predecessor, but it actually enhances it with a very morbid and cold-hearted appeal. It's depressing to the bone, I but I get kick out of any films that create this sort of tone! Though what made the original rejuvenating was that it had warm and natural relationships between the characters, especially between Bridget and Ginger, but also with the parents. Because of the sequel's depressing vibe, it does lack the heartache of the horrifying matter that drove the sisters even closer in the first film. Also it sorely does miss the characteristic interactions between the sisters. Although saying that they do share some screen time here, but only in small doses meaning far less impact. <br /><br />The plot is an absorbing one, which doesn't break a whole lot of new ground like the original, but still comes up with enough hunger to set it out from most other horror flicks of the last decade, but also adding another dimension to the tale. Just like in the first film and like many reviewers have painted it's a metaphor for adolescent life, from angst, drugs and sex. But this cocktail is mixed with a refreshing twist involving the werewolf mythology, introducing the metaphor part of all of this. The snappy script holds up well and the story moves along pretty quickly with enough excitement initiated and the twists are far from easy to detect. No way is this story's structure predictable! The actual ending was kind of clever, but felt odd and left me feeling a little unsatisfied. The editing was swiftly sharp and potent to the pacing. It also recaptures the slickly handled production of that of the original, but it looks like it had more to work with here. That's especially because the special effects and werewolf designs were vastly better this time around and the attacks were more callous and bloodier. The isolated setting was made to great use with its cold wintry backdrop and gloomy awe. The action might have up the ante in this sequel, but so did the soundtrack by igniting itself with the Gothic and haunting tunes that made the original great. The upbeat tempo of the soundtrack bounds the mood. The spectral sound effects also worked its way into the picture and it was hard to shut out its thumping vibration throughout. The out-and-out stylistic camera-work sinuously develops some inventive shots. The direction by Brett Sullivan is above par and he hones down his skills with preciseness but adding such tautness and tension to the picture. The performances were magnificent. Emily Perkins comes out of the shadow of Katharine Isabelle here, and she made the most of it by turning in a convincing performance. Tatiana Maslany as Ghost one of the kids in the clinic provides on the humour side of things and Eric Johnson is perfectly scummy as one of the workers at the clinic. Katharine Isabelle makes some small but yet effective glimpses and adds in with some voice-overs. This production most definitely went one step bigger.<br /><br />After two worthy werewolf films, I wonder if the film makers can repeat this winning formula in their third flick of the series Ginger Snaps Back: The Beginning (2004) or will it come crashing back to earth with a thud. The sequel is very much on par with the original and definitely well worth the look. Actually I would say it's a must-see if you seen the original.
Ginger Snaps 2: Unleashed. * * 1/2 Actors: Emily Perkins, Tatiana Maslany, Eric Johnson Writer: Megan Martin Director: Brett Sullivan.<br /><br />The second part of the "Ginger Snaps" trilogy picks up after the first one. Bridgitte has infected herself with Ginger's blood who has turned into a werewolf. In order to keep herself from becoming like her sister, she must inject herself daily with monkshood. After barely escaping a werewolf that has found her, she awakes in a clinic that treats all things including drug addiction. With her drugs taken away, Bridgitte can't escape what she is becoming.<br /><br />I loved the 1st movie and I found the second one to be a worthwhile sequel. While the first one simmered with satire on female hormones and puberty, "Unleashed" is a straight horror film. It's too bad we don't see much of Ginger in this one, but she does turn up as a ghost who warns Bridgitte that another one waits for her. Bridgitte is a lot more confident and a lot hotter than the first one. But although this is her story, the one character that steals the show is a young girl at the hospital named Ghost. Bridgitte befriends this girl because she can help get her monkshood and I'm sure she feels a little bad that all the other patients make fun of her. There is a twist at the end of this movie that I was not expecting, but on my second viewing of it. I don't know how I could have missed it. All the warning signs were shown in the first thirty minutes.<br /><br />If you haven't seen the first one you could just watch this one alone. It has a good enough story to keep you interested. It's not as fulfilling as the original, but it's a nice desert
I liked it a lot, in fact even more than the first movie. I loved the character of Ghost and all the comic book shots and her third person lines. Good ending. One thing they could have done was make the identity of the werewolf clearer. Also when the sister appeared it was kind of forced.. it didn't seem like she was a delusion
This is the only sequel I have seen that could be considered an improvement on its original.<br /><br />I'm a great Fan of Ginger Snaps and was really excited about this film when i first heard about it, unfortunately when it arrived at the cinema I was to young to see it. I'm sure its always a gamble for people and film fans alike to buy movies on Tapoe/DVD with out viewing them first and for me this was a first. It was well worth the risk of my cash as I loved the film, the casting was especially good this time around ( the DVD showing the auditions in all their glory ) As far as the films go Emily Perkins takes her original part and runs with it, totally convincing the audience that she is trying to break away from her sister and the ghosts of the past.<br /><br />The special effects and make up are of course grander this time around which enhances the horror side of things, but I my self view this more as a Drama that a Horror film. The suspense is really edgy and makes you want to fast forward to the next scene to see what happens next. As well as the stand allow story of Briditte's new company 'Ghost' making you want more as the plot continues. Even as a sequel this is a hard one to beat. I whole heartedly will you to see it, even if you have not yet view the first one.
"Ginger Snaps:Unleashed" is a pretty smart sequel to my beloved werewolf horror "Ginger Snaps".Brigitte is an addict.After mixing blood with her sister Ginger she has been infected with the virus.Each day the curse grows stronger and she must increase her dosage of injections.When she is found lying face down in the snow after the near escape from another beast,she is thrown into drug rehabilitation-locked behind the doors without her life-saving antidote."Ginger Snaps:Unleashed" is almost as good as the first one.The soundtrack is awesome and creates a creepy atmosphere of desperation and isolation.There is plenty of gore and violence and some really vicious werewolf attacks.The acting is excellent with outstanding performance by Emily Perkins.The film is really tense,so if you liked the original you won't be disappointed.Highly recommended.
"Ginger Snaps" single-handedly raised my interest in lycanthropic cinema, and "Ginger Snaps Unleashed" is a remarkably strong sequel that works for many of the same reasons. Like the thoughtful horror cinema of George Romero, where deeper human issues boil under a more obvious horror surface, "Ginger Snaps" used lycanthropy as a metaphor for puberty and its impact on teenage relationships; "Unleashed" uses it as a metaphor for addiction, with Brigitte Fitzgerald (Emily Perkins--"It"), sister of the ill-fated Ginger (Katharine Isabelle), injecting herself with wolfbane to curb her increasingly wolf-like tendencies. While in a rehab clinic for troubled teens, Brigitte forges a relationship with Ghost (Tatiana Maslany), a precocious girl whose seeming innocence unravels her secret. The new writing/directing team of Megan Martin and Brett Sullivan pick up where the previous film left off, skillfully bridging the two with a bare minimum of rehashed exposition, and the end result is extremely satisfying (though the machinations of "Unleashed"'s final third made me wish the script had tied some thematic/character arcs together better). Perkins, who is becoming a real horror ingénue, plays Brigitte with sympathy and sarcastic bite, and her relationship with Maslany comes close to matching the sense of sisterly love that provided the endearing backbone of the original "Ginger Snaps." "Unleashed" is the rare sequel that does its parent proud.
Brigitte (Emily Perkins) is alone, after killing her sister Ginger (Katharine Isabelle), and injecting a substance called monkshood to delay the process of transformation in a werewolf. She has an overdose and is sent to a rehabilitation clinic, where she is mistakenly taken as a drug addicted. Meanwhile, a beast is chasing her, trying to become mated with her. Ginger escapes from the clinic with Ghost (Tatiana Maslany), a needy and lonely girl that wants to be friend of Brigitte. "Ginger Snaps: Unleashed" is a great sequel of "Ginger Snaps". The participation of Katharine Isabelle is minimum and basically is limited to give her name to the credits. However, Emily Perkins has another excellent performance in the dramatic role of a young woman fighting against her fate. This sequel is very claustrophobic and also very violent, but it deserved a better conclusion. The story is better than the first one, but I was a little disappointed with the end. My vote is seven.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "Possuída 2" ("Possessed 2")
After the explosively entertaining "Ginger Snaps", I had some doubts that the sequels could live up to the original. But in this one, we are greeted to a wonderful film picking up exactly where the first one left off: now with Bridget trying to stop herself from becoming a werewolf, and escaping from the rehab center she has been placed in.<br /><br />If you find cutting and self-mutilation to be disgusting, then this is the film you want to either see or avoid. The opening credits are over a scene of Bridget in the bathtub, cutting herself to pieces. She continues to cut herself throughout the movie, as well as give herself injections.<br /><br />The scenery is fantastic, as rehabs, hospitals and insane asylums are always great places for horror films if you know how to film them. The makers of this film know exactly what they're doing. Add secret passageways and you're set.<br /><br />The new cast is also wonderful, easily making up for Ginger having a very small role. The cast now has several male staffers working in an all-girl rehab center, leading to such activities as trading sexual favors for drugs. But most importantly is a new character named "Ghost" (presumably because she's almost like an albino) who is fascinated with the occult and death and befriends Bridget after finding out she might be a werewolf.<br /><br />Some interesting plot twists happen I can't reveal here, and as the wolf blood begins to overtake the human blood, things heat up. And then another werewolf shows up to try and mate.<br /><br />Oh, heck. Just watch the movie. These guys have taken a worn-out horror staple (lycanthropy) and added such a new dimension to it that it's almost like an entirely new invention. Excelsior!
This is a pretty good sequel for the most part that's quite entertaining, with fantastic performances, however it comes nowhere close to matching the original. All the characters are pretty cool, and the story was solid, plus Emily Perkins is simply amazing in this!. I was really disappointed that Katharine Isabelle was so wasted in this as she only has a few lines, and I thought Tatiana Maslany was brilliant as the psycho Ghost as she was really creepy and unpredictable, plus it had quite a few tense scenes. while it is good it just didn't have the magic the 1st did, and while the ending is really quite surprising, I never did care too much for it,plus Emily is able to match her amazing performance in the 1st!. It's decently made and written, and it also leaves open the possibility of another sequel which I would love to see, however like the 1st the Werewolf effects Wern't that great. There is a freaky masturbation scene, and I love the setting in the creepy hospital, plus all the characters were quite likable. This is a pretty good sequel for the most part that's quite entertaining with fantastic performances, however it comes nowhere near close to matching the original in my opinion, still I highly recommend it. The Direction is quite good!. Brett Sullivan does quite a good job here with effective camera work, solid angles, using a creepy setting, adding creepy atmosphere some good POV shots, and lots of other cool shots as well, plus he kept the film at a fast pace for the most part.<br /><br />There is a bit of blood and gore. We get bloody self mutilation, bloody werewolf attacks, glimpses of pretty gory corpses, skin cut off of someone's ear, nasty transformation scenes, hammer in the head (at least I think it was), quite a bit of blood, and other minor stuff.<br /><br />The Acting is fantastic!. Emily Perkins is amazing as always and is amazing here, she is extremely likable, tough but vulnerable, had pretty good chemistry with Tatiana Maslany, is incredibly gorgeous, was quite intense, and you will really care for her character, she really did match her amazing performance in the 1st here, and it will be very interesting to see what her character will be like if they make a true sequel to this (full Werewolf?) (Perkins Rules!!!!!!!). Tatiana Maslany is brilliant as Ghost, she played the creepy psycho very well yet she still managed to be quite likable, she was also energetic had some good lines, had a wicked character, and was totally unpredictable, I predict big things for this young actress!. Eric Johnson is great as Tyler he was a bit of an ass and very cocky, but somehow yet still charming and quite likable I dug him for some reason, he did a good job. Janet Kidder is decent as Alice and did what she had to do adequately. Katharine Isabelle is still gorgeous as ever, but had only a few scenes was totally wasted! which was incredibly disappointing, I mean it was great to see her but I began thinking why did she even agree to make a few appearances with minimal dialog?. Rest of the cast are fine. Overall I highly recommend it. ***1/2 out of 5
So just to recap the events of the original "Ginger Snaps" (SPOILERS!!!), Ginger and Brigette are sisters ... Ginger is bitten by a werewolf ... Ginger begins to turn into a werewolf ... Brigette infects herself with Ginger's blood ... Brigette kills Ginger.<br /><br />We rejoin Brigette after an undisclosed period of time. She's living in a cheap motel room in a city somewhere, shooting up on wolfsbane and keeping a chart of how long it takes for self-inflicted wounds to heal -- hoping against hope that she might never become a werewolf. Occasionally she is visited by the ghost of her dead sister, who haunts and taunts her throughout the movie (you can't have a Ginger Snaps movie without a Ginger, right?). One night she manages to overdose on wolfsbane, and she gets picked up and taken to an outreach centre where she is kept caged like an animal and deprived of the drug ... but what they don't know is that she's being hunted by another deadly werewolf, who has a strong desire to mate with her.<br /><br />Ginger Snaps : Unleashed is even darker than the original, both in the metaphorical and in the literal sense of the word. It's also a lot weirder ... so if, like me, you're a big fan of weird, odds are you'll probably lap this up like a bloodthirsty wolf. There are plenty of great twists and turns in the plot, and the casting is really amazing. Eric Johnson and the young Tatiana Maslany both deliver superb performances in the two main supporting roles. In most respects, many agree that this sequel is in fact better than the first movie ... but they're both so great, I don't even feel the need to compare them.<br /><br />I was a bit concerned about the fact that this wasn't written by the same team as the first movie (in fact screenwriter Megan Martin seems to have no other credits to her name), but it is actually an interesting twist on the original, written by someone who clearly understood what Ginger Snaps was all about. There are two main formulaic werewolf plots ... the first involves our hero changing into a werewolf, which will eventually lead either to finding a cure or to their death (as in the first movie), and the second is about a group of characters being stalked by a werewolf, and for an added twist perhaps the werewolf is one of them. This film incorporates both of these formulas into an excellent, engaging horror story.<br /><br />Ginger Snaps is probably the first great werewolf movie to have a worthy sequel, and if that wasn't enough they had to go and do it again a third time. If you haven't seen this whole trilogy yet, you definitely should.
In the sequel to the cult horror hit "Ginger Snaps", Brigitte(Emily Perkins) finds herself transforming into the same monster that killed her sister. She has been injecting herself with too much monkshood, she o.d's, is mistaken for a junkie and wins herself a trip to the "Happier Times" rehab center. There Brigitte meets a young girl named Ghost(Tatiana Maslany)who is a very strange and curious kid and might help Brigitte with the cure. The two of them become very close, almost like sisters even, but now Brigitte has a bigger problem, another werewolf has been stalking her and now he wants to mate. I am probably the biggest fan of Ginger Snaps and I was highly anticipating the sequel. As soon as I saw the opening credits, I knew that I was in for a treat. Emily Perkins was simply amazing, the gore was beautiful and the dark humor and atmosphere were similar to the first one. The makeup was better where as the first Ginger Snaps was more emotional. Of course it wasn't as good as the first one but what sequel ever really is? Like I said, the acting and makeup was awesome and the soundtrack was great too. I also really enjoyed the short but sweet appearances by my beloved Katharine Isabelle as Ginger. The ending was very disappointing though, it kind of ruined the whole movie for me. But if I forget the last 10 minutes, this movie was excellent and almost gave me as much pleasure as the first one. I would give Ginger Snaps II:Unleashed 8/10.
I have yet to see the first Ginger snap or any other Ginger snaps movies in the series.<br /><br />I saw this when it came on TV once, all i knew about this movie before I watched it, was that it had something to do with a werewolf.<br /><br />Brigitte seem to be haunted by her dead sister, who a was werewolf too and she will become too but she then takes a deadly second dose of monkshood, which would stop her of changing into werewolf. Jeremy with her library books at her door and he see that she has taken drugs and then is about to take her to the hospital but is attacked.<br /><br />After that She wakes up in rehab clinic for drug abusing girls. she locked up and a little girls know about this and then helps her out to get more drugs to help her not to turn into a werewolf.<br /><br />This was really interesting werewolf movie, I didn't find IT boring, which i thought I would, but it was really entertaining movie,They had some really nasty bloody deaths in here too and i did like how the werewolf looked, it was little scary.<br /><br />The acting from the main girl was really good, the rest of cast was just okay but the little girl acting was really poor. <br /><br />I give this movie 7 out of 10
good Canadian movies are a hard jem to find ( as is any Canadian one) but this one is somewhat easier to find<br /><br />after watching the first one i immediately needed to view the second and i isn't a letdown in any way to its predecessor.<br /><br />the story follows Bridgette after running away from her dark past. shes completely changed except for the fact shes still a werewolf, and is now an independent woman with some "problems" but soon after passing out in a snowbank from an overdose of monkshood is taken into a drug clinic and the story begins there.<br /><br />if you thought the first one was to dark, then you may have to watch this movie of an extended period of time<br /><br />any wean this movie is amazing in every single way buy it NOW!!
It really makes me mad to see fellow Canadians praising such a dumb movie, especially when its as horrible as this. I don't think Ive ever seen another movie, horror or otherwise, where absolutely NOTHING happens for so long. Like the amount of boredom in this movie is actually unsettling. The entire movie is filler right from the get go. 45 minutes in and still nothing, just pointless conversation that Im guessing was supposed to be the character development? We get a girl brooding into the mirror trying to conceal her secret but yeah thats about it...for 45 MINUTES! Then we get a 3 minute chase scene, then revert to 30 more minutes of nothing. End of movie.<br /><br />Acting/budget are never a factor in horror so I wont comment on them. Usually plot holes and such shouldn't be a factor but there's just so much lameness with the whole rehab clinic and so many "Im so sure" moments, they'll be constantly on your mind agitating you. (since, chances are, NOTHING will be happening on screen.) An anti-climatic ending, no scares, no jumps, no gore, no laughs, nothing. Not a single fun scene in the whole movie.<br /><br />Seriously, if you want a horror with developed characters pulled off right, and with stuff actually happening, go rent the remarkable Pumpkinhead and avoid this straight to video nonsense. One of the most wildly inept horror/thriller flicks that Ive seen in recent memory, and believe me, Ive seen them all.
This sequel picks up shortly after the first film ends. We meet Brigitte in a Despair Montage. You know the sort I mean -- clips of ostensibly mundane images edited together with some heavy music, to indicate a wretched emotional state. Brigitte is alone and clearly desperate. She looks and sounds like a junkie. Which she is -- though not for your standard drugs. After an incident which is probably not hallucinatory -- but which the film leaves deliberately ambiguous, since Brigitte has just o.d.'d -- Brigitte is consigned to a rehab clinic.<br /><br />Now, I don't know anything about the day-to-day realities of the Canadian public health system. But I seriously doubt that anything is as creepy and weird and unsettlingly earnest as this place. The halfway house director, Alice, is a very fine character. Played by Canadian actress Janet Kidder, Alice is surprisingly three-dimensional for her cardboard role. Kudos to Kidder. I mean, really. The Rehab Director Who Won't Believe You is kinda a feature of these sorts of films.<br /><br />All right, I'm going to digress.<br /><br />The most interesting thing about horror movies is the part which no-one thought about. In the creation of a horror film, the screenwriters and directors think about many things. Dialog. Cineamatography. Score. Special FX. MPAA ratings. Coolness. One of the least thought-about items in most cases is the backstory of the plot. Horror starts with a Bad Thing Happening. The audience is given a vague series of hand-waving gestures as to how the Bad Thing came to be, and that's it. It is the least important thing.<br /><br />Which makes it incredibly interesting to me. What happens, see, is that the writers reach for something easy for the audience. For example. In the 1960's everything was a result of leaked radiation. In the late 1970's and early 1980's everything was caused by premarital sex and psychological obsessions. In the 1930's everything was caused by travelling to foreign places and meeting weird people.<br /><br />The first causes of things in horror films are facile glosses of cultural fears. That's point one.<br /><br />The second things that interests me in horror films is who the real villain is. Not the monster, or the bad guy, or the alien who eats your face. Who is the one that does the human-scale evil that leads to the ultimate disaster. The real, understandable villain. In Nightmare on Elm Street the real villain was and is always the parents who murdered Fred Krueger and who subsequently refused to aid their children in any way with the consequences of their actions. In Psycho it's Norman's mother, who twisted him so awfully. In Scream 3 (and this is stretching the point a bit -- but only a bit) it's Hollywood, for how it eats its actors alive.<br /><br />The third thing that I love about horror films is the pretext for helplessness. The protagonists is always helpless for much of the film. Why? Is the villain all-powerful? Are they trapped in a spaceship? Does society refuse to believe them? Are massive corporations hiding the evidence? What strips the protagonists of their power? Or, did they have any power in the first place? (Which, box office dynamics aside, is one reason why horror films feature teens. They have agency and some power, but never, ever enough.) In terms of the things that interest me, Unleashed scores quite high. Birgitte is stripped of her power in two ways. First, she is degrading from within due to the disease. Second, her means of controlling herself is taken away by being locked in rehab. The real villain in the film I will NOT tell you. But. The entire message of the film is one of the nature of human response to internal evil.<br /><br />I'll say that again.<br /><br />Werewolf movies are always about how you choose to deal with your internal evil.<br /><br />Which leads me to the most interesting thing about horror movies, the thoughtless choice of first causes. Yes, yes, hot werewolf chicks are cool. We all know this. Whatever. I'm not talking about that. The first film was about what happens when the powerless get power. But the parallel message of GS was that power does not grant you license to do what you darn well please. GS:U continues that second theme.<br /><br />Brigitte simply refuses to give in to everything she wants, though she knows it's hopeless. Though she is attacked from inside her own self. Attacked by what she wants more than anything in the world. Her own desires are her enemy.<br /><br />So why make a movie with this theme? I think that once a theme is identified in a horror film, all one has to do to answer why is look around at the culture. I don't really know what Canadian anxieties are right now. So my guess is that this film is playing off of societal fears of Canada being infected by the cultural madness of the US, which fosters some of people's secret worst desires and makes them something to be proud of. Religious zealotry and intolerance, xenophobia, and warmongering disguised as patriotism are all things I think Canadians are culturally nervous about. As well as a fear/pride ambivalence -- they think they are strong enough to withstand our cultural imperialism, but are a little afraid that maybe, secretly, they'll like it and give in.<br /><br />Infected with a disease that forces you to revel in everything you hate in yourself. Sounds like a werewolf flick to me.
In the long history of cinema, not many sequels have been of the highest quality. And while "Ginger Snaps II" is not better than the original, I'm proud to have it as a sequel to one of my favorite horror movies of all time. And as a Canadian, I'm very proud that our filmmakers are capable of making a horror franchise that maintains not only the scare-factor, but also a lot of much-needed dignity.<br /><br />SPOILERS<br /><br />Brigitte is on the run from the events of the first movie. The monkshood drug that saved Jason in the first movie is apparently not permanently effective, and she has to take it repeatedly to stop the transformation. A werewolf is searching for her (presumably Jason from the first movie transformed from not taking more monskhood), and wants to mate with her. When Brigitte is found unconscious on the street carrying syringes and monskhood, she's taken to a rehab clinic for drug-abusers.<br /><br />This movie is very different from the first one. Brigitte's transformation is very different from Ginger's. She keeps having visions of Ginger, who tries to tell her that the inevitable is, in fact, inevitable. The strong characters remain in this entry. Ghost could not be creepier, and Tyler could not be more of a jerk. But what impressed me about this movie was that it still managed to be scary. Very close, in fact, to the first movie. The suspense is strong, and the use of dead silence is perfectly executed. And, like the first movie, I was happy not to see a drop of CGI throughout the whole thing.<br /><br />END OF SPOILERS<br /><br />I was lucky enough to win free passes to see this movie two days earlier than everyone else, and boy am I glad. I can't say I have any real problem with this movie. It's quite excellent. The first movie is better because...it's the first one. That's all I can say.<br /><br />8/10
This movie was absolutely the best werewolf movie ever made! It was so good, that, if I didn't have a short attention span, I would watch it back-to-back every day!<br /><br />First of all, the acting, once again, was superb. Emily Perkins does a wonderful job as Brigitte, and the new character, Ghost, was perfect, although her lines seemed a little too rehearsed. <br /><br />I really like the dark humor in it, once again. I like movies that can be dramatic, somewhat scary, and funny all at once (all movies should be!). I don't know how people can say that they don't like this movie. I do!<br /><br />The ending, where Ghost traps the transforming Brigitte in her cellar, and then welcomes her grandma home, is perfectly dark. I kinda think it's mean that she wants to hurt her grandma, but it goes with the plot. I especially like the very end, when she's reading the comic, and she says something like, "And off she went on her reign of terror, to vanquish her mortal enemies, of which there were many."<br /><br />I don't know why I like it so much, it's just perfect.
Title: Ginger Snaps 2: Unleashed <br /><br />Director: Brett Sullivan <br /><br />Cast: Emily Perkins, Katherine Isabelle, Tatiana Maslany, Eric Johnson <br /><br />Tagline: It only dies if you do <br /><br />Review: After having enjoyed the first Ginger Snaps immensely I decided to check out the sequel which had the same to actresses who played sisters on the last film. Did it live up to the coolness of the original? Well no, to be honest.<br /><br />The story follows Bridgette who after being bitten by her own sister on the last film is now also suffering the painful and slow process of becoming a werewolf. She uses a drug to help slow down the process, but how long will it last? Not a lot of time passes until she ends up in a rehab center and befriends a bunch of messed up junkie girls. The authorities believe that Bridgette is just a junkie in need of some serious rehabilitation. The girls she meets in the center are similar to the group of screwed up kids seen in Nightmare on Elm Street III: The Dream Warriors.<br /><br />What I liked about the movie was its look. It was well shot and had some stylish camera angles...also some of the characters were very very likable. Like for example the little girl who plays "ghost" she was an interesting character and one of the coolest things about the movie. She quickly befriends Bridgette due to the fact that she doest have many friends. I liked her right of the bat just cause she reads and constantly quotes her horror comics. The character of Ghost is the only thing original that this movie has to offer, aside from her and the sub plot with her grandmother, there's nothing new in Ginger Snaps 2.<br /><br />The problem with the movie is that for the longest time it just draaaags. The whole movie is just about one thing. Teasing you. You keep thinking that eventually your going to see Bridgette transform. Many times through out the film she is found in exactly the same situation...just seconds away from transforming...but then she takes that drug and everything goes back to normal. Its like watching an episode of the Hulk in which Bruce Banner never transforms into the hulking beast. For a long time...nothing really happens. The movie just stretches to the point of boredom. Until the last 15 minutes of course.<br /><br />This is supposed to be a werewolf movie, yet there's hardly any werewolf action. We only get to see one werewolf and hes hidden in shadows and quick cuts. I wished we could have seen more of the creature we came to see. Could it be that the director is afraid of showing his low budget creature? Hmm..at leas the first one showed the werewolf even if it wasn't the best looking one, it was there.<br /><br />Sadly we only get to see katherine Isabelle in a small cameo, she was a huge part in what made the first one so much fun, here shes just a watcher, a character who really does nothing except comment on what she sees and torments Bridgette. The chemistry between the two sisters which was in a large part what made the first one so enjoyable is completely gone! That sucked big time for me.<br /><br />In conclusion this movie had some good characters, a monster that wouldn't show and some nice camera shots. Gone is the chemistry between Bridgette and Ginger and the punch that the first movie had. I don't get whey there's so many positive reviews for this film it was alright, but sadly not as good as the first.<br /><br />Rating: 21/2 out of 5
I thought this movie was brilliant. I am a huge fan of the Ginger Snaps series and I think this one is amazing. This film is mainly about Brigitte, as the first one was mainly about Ginger. Although Ginger does appear for a few minutes in some bits of the movie, Brigitte has the majority of the movie. Some may be disappointed as Ginger is gone, but Brigitte is very good in her role which makes up for Ginger's absence. Emily Perkins, in my opinion, plays Brigitte Fitzgerald far better in this movie than the first. For one, she has real hair now. Secondly, Brigitte has a huge contrast to the other character in the movie, which attracts you to her dark personality more. One of those attracted is the comic book obsessed Ghost, who is fascinated by the mysterious sister and wants to know more about her. But Brigitte being Brigitte, she's become very anti-social. Ghost is a strange girl. She doesn't seem to be able to divide the comic book world from the real world, which can make her annoying as she seems to go on about darkness and such. She's a chatterbox, and is constantly pestering Brigitte, wondering what she is hiding from everyone. The werewolves in Ginger Snaps II: Unleashed were far better than the original Ginger Snaps movie. These werewolves have developed from the weird pink things they were before and now have fur, proper fangs and scary yellow eyes! I would recommend this movie to whoever liked the first one. It's got a bit less gore and more sexual references, but the darkness of Brigitte's role and the weird Ghost makes this film amazing. *10*
The original Ginger Snaps was a refreshing take on the werewolf story - the way that it blended the similarities in the story with the puberty of teenage girls was both amusing and original and it proved that there was still some originality left in the genre. This first sequel isn't quite as good as the original, but there's still much to like about it. The story follows Brigitte, the more weird and less sexy of the two sisters from the first film who is now changing into a werewolf herself. For some reason that is never properly explained, she has infected herself with the curse via Ginger's blood and has gotten herself addicted to the cure, the plant; monkshood, in order to stop herself changing into a werewolf like her sister did. However, all is not so simple, as another werewolf is on the rampage and is stalking Brigitte because it wants to...ahem, mate with her. After surviving an attack from it, Brigitte is picked up by the police and taken to a rehabilitation clinic where she meets a whole host of new characters, including, most notably, a young weirdo called Ghost.<br /><br />Making a welcome return from the first film is the parallels that are drawn between turning into a werewolf and being a teenager. It's not put forward as forcefully as it was in the original and it seems to concentrate more on the drug taking tearaway side of being a teenager as opposed to the more normal side. There is significantly less humour in this outing, as the parents that delivered most of it last time round have been dropped, but one thing I did find rather amusing was the way that the film used the wolf that wants to mate with Brigitte: probably a commentary on hormonal young men. Unfortunately, Katherine Isabelle who played Ginger in the original film isn't in this film as much as most viewers would like, and she serves the plot in more of an advisory capacity (much like the ghost in American Werewolf in London) and this doesn't allow her much screen time (although this will hopefully be rectified in the prequel; Ginger Snaps Back). One thing that this film definitely has over the original is the werewolf effects; they were terrible in the first film and really let it down, but here they seem to have taken influence from Dog Soldiers and look much better for it.<br /><br />The new cast of characters don't make up for the relative loss of Ginger, but nevertheless; they're largely well done. Ginger's "replacement" is the aforementioned young girl, known as 'Ghost'. Ghost is an interesting character, and despite being a child; doesn't manage to become annoying, which is rare. The other two main characters are a male nurse, and a drugs councillor, both of which serve as metaphors for different roles in teenage life. What sets this film apart from many modern day horror films of this nature is that it's story driven, and rather restrained in the gore department. The film also has an atmosphere of tragedy throughout. This is one of the things I liked best about the original; the dark and morbidity of what's happening on screen consolidates with the characters, and are almost an extension of those characters; which also serves in giving the film a degree of intelligence.<br /><br />The tragedy of the first film was brought to a head by way of it's brilliant and heartbreaking ending, and this film would have to work hard if it was even going to attempt at topping it. It didn't top it - the ending here, although good, and very imaginative isn't as well done as the idea suggests it could have been; and that's a shame. Other than that, however; this is one of the best horror sequels in a long time, and comes with the highest recommendation.
Respectable, even impressive follow-up to the sharp-witted Canadian horror indie. This one doesn't have the sustained thematic focus of the first, but all in all it's as twisted, watchable, and occasionally amusing as fans of the series would hope. If Emily Perkins's performance doesn't blow us away as it did in `Ginger Snaps,' that's only because it's not as much of a surprise this time around, and Tatiana Maslany's Ghost makes a goofy but plausible addition to the films' world. As I said, it's not the out-and-out allegory that the first film was, but there are rich satiric moments, flashes of wit (Brigitte's discovery of her hairy palms comes to mind), and nice nods to werewolf-movie convention, with the finale taking place in a remote cabin in the snowy woods. There are a few problems too--a weak, TV-ish performance by Eric Johnson, completely unnecessary cameos by Ginger herself, and worst of all an unfair and somewhat sad shift of focus at the end. But these things don't really diminish `Ginger Snaps 2's' accomplishments, and it remains an entertaining and original new horror film--a very rare thing these days. 7.5 out of 10.
Wow. What a great flick. I daresay it may even be better than the original. I say may, because the final scenes are a bit of an unnecessary letdown considering the buildup. While at first I thought I would miss Ginger, I realized her parts in this were pretty superfluous and could've been left out, since Bridgette was very capable of handling the film on her own. Of course then you couldn't have matching DVD covers. Atmosphere is way ramped up on this one (even the opening credits gave me the creeps, ugh) and the soundtrack definitely adds to the dread. A few nice scares and gore shots. This one was much more depressing than the first, which in my book is never a bad thing.<br /><br />
Loving "Ginger Snaps", a film which if you're like me felt left too many unanswered questions, coming into "Ginger Snaps 2" I was eager to see not only how they answered the unanswered questions, but seeing if they could keep the name Ginger Snaps still alive. Well I suppose they did but only in spirit, but it could have been worse. If you're reading this I'm assuming you've seen "Ginger Snaps 1" if not, goodbye thanks for reading. Anyways, I loved how the film was pretty much all about Bridgette, not that hated Ginger it's just I really didn't want to deal with one of the problems with Ginger Snaps 1 again which was the constant deal of: I'm okay, no I'm a wolf, No I'm okay, I hate you, now I don't, Now I do! You know, it gets old fast, so therefore having a on woman show with Bridgette I liked. Overall Ginger Snaps 2 isn't exactly a bad sequel, it's just an attempt that was just a little too safe. Ginger Snaps took a risk, after just recovering from the Columbine Massacre and other uproars in teen violence, Ginger Snaps 1 could have been more appropriate, but they weren't and it worked. Here with Ginger Snaps 2 there is no risk visible, and in the end this is probably how Ginger Snap 1 would have been if it had been safe. Sure I'll admit a sequel to a cult classics like Ginger Snaps is a challenge enough, but as a sequel I think it should want to be better, but here it feels more like they don't want to offend anybody (being the fans) so they play it safe. I loved how for the beginning they truly focus on the aftermath of part 1 (which is the funnest part of sequels, just getting to say "Hey I was there I saw that with you!" is fun), because it's fun to continue with the story from part 1. However as it descends from that it just becomes boring, and just like any other face in the crowd, and doesn't really have anything newer or anything to make it stand out like Ginger Snaps did. Perhaps the main thing is how they make certain characters bigger characters than they truly need to be. Ghost being the biggest example, she was annoying, to desperate, and honestly needed to die. Pretty much after Bridgette and Ghost escape the hospital is where it gets bad. All in all it's not exactly a bad movie it's just it's nothing special, even if it weren't a preceded sequel to Ginger Snaps, and like I said it's very safe. Besides even still as a sequel there are still too many unanswered questions, and don't even get me started on that ending. If you're a fan of Ginger Snaps, I'd see this one only too say you saw it.
I am a die hard fan of the original Ginger Snaps, and this sequel is like having to use Windows 3.1 my whole life. I tried to allow for the curse of high expectations. What I did not expect was that this movie would raise them by starting with an excellent, original story concept, good music, an edgy atmosphere and a solid gold performance by Emily Perkins. Those are the only things I can recommend about this film, however, and half of those are thrown out midway through the story.<br /><br />The film's downfall is the screenplay, which was written by Megan Martin, who apparently had no previous screen writing experience. True, Karen Walton, who wrote the original (with director John Fawcett) also had no experience, but she also worked on that script for four years. It is harder to write for somebody else's character creations. For a sequel to a successful movie with a fan base, only chintziness could explain hiring a first-time writer for the sequel.<br /><br />So, with practically no help from the dialog, Perkins carries the entire first half of the film as the lonely, doomed Brigitte, bereft of Ginger, and bitterly fighting her own animalistic changes. The difference in Brigitte's character after the traumas she suffered in the first movie are both believably sad and shocking, showing that Perkins is an actress of the highest caliber. When Brigitte is found unconscious on a street with needle and cut marks on her arms, authorities assume she is a junkie and put her into a teen rehab center. It turned out that monkshood did not cure the curse, it simply delays it. So, she is trapped and can't prevent her transformation in a place where she endangers many people, and, of course, the staff doesn't believe her.<br /><br />From this mind-blowing story-concept we go to tedium, as the movie puts 75 minutes of material into 90 minutes. Midway through, it comes to life briefly, and then changes directions giving up everything it had going for it. Martin had written Brigitte into a corner, and so changed subject. I must admit here that I did not like the approach of dooming Brigitte from the beginning, and the twist at the end made me want to shoot the DVD as a traitor.<br /><br />Martin has made Brigitte far too restrained, including with people who would turn a Quaker homicidal. She only partially loses her temper once, and as a character noted, it was measured. Brundel's law as it applies to werewolves is, there are no such thing as pacifist werewolves, or rather, any werewolf movie depicting them is a bomb. While Perkins does her best, in the many pauses in the dialog, depicting Brigitte as holding back her fury, it simply does not work in a werewolf movie, or in a horror movie. If the audience is asked to believe that a werewolf could be that restrained, they begin to doubt it is even a problem. <br /><br />Katharine Isabelle continues her role as Ginger, who is dead of course, and who only Brigitte can see. Isabelle only has about fifteen lines, though. These are the sorts of lines that can only be delivered in the sleepiest way possible, and it can't be called dialog because usually Brigitte doesn't answer. Isabelle's part is almost all commentary and adds nothing to the plot. Her role seems half contractual obligation, half trailer-bait material. Mostly she just taunts Brigitte's about her futile efforts to fight the curse. Of all people, Brigitte and Ginger should still have a lot to say to each other. This is a huge waste of an actress who showed her mettle in the original.<br /><br />No, instead, the movie is wrecked by Martin's new character. Tatiana Maslani as "Ghost" does a good job as a mentally ill young girl, obsessed with comics. It's a good character concept, really, and Maslani does do an excellent job. Even so, putting Ghost in and making her a major character respectively required an unbelievable explanation and an idiot plot. I felt like she belonged in her own movie and was just an intruder here. Worse, she crowded out a larger part for Katharine Isabelle, and the movie is called "Ginger Snaps: Unleashed," right?<br /><br />Finally, I have to point out the werewolf makeup is BAD in this film. I never knew werewolves had sow's ears and third-degree burns on their lips. At one point, they make Perkins look like Keith Richards, and by the end, she looks like an orc with an immobile mask so embarrassing that would have looked cheesy in the '60s. Except for the mask at the end, this is probably not the make-up artist's fault. The makeup actually looks better on the DVD extras and in the publicity photos than it does in the movie. This suggests the problem was with the Lighting, the Director of Photography, or the Director. <br /><br />Nevertheless, the movie does get the special effects right for the fully animalized werewolf. <br /><br />Other fans of the original seem to like this movie, but I can't help but see it as a major disappointment, though not a disaster. There was a much better story to be told here. Unlike the original, this did not have Karen Walton and four years of work on the screenplay. It fails on its own promise, too, and not only by the standards the original set for it.
I don't really need to say anything about the excellence in Emily's performance as Brigitte, do i, Katherine is also great as ever, in her best role, only rivaled by her little part in Freddy vs. Jason.<br /><br />but i wanted to talk a little about 'Ghost', played by 'young' Tatiana Maslany, i have written young in lines because when i watched the movie i thought, about 11 up to 14, not older, no way, but she was 19 at the time, unbelievable!!! but she was so very good as the little innocent girl ghost pretended to be and she kinda really looks like a little cute teenage girl, the kind you normally call friend of your little sister or some sort of that.<br /><br />and the twist at the end with ghost was just brilliant, because you always believed Tatiana her role, but there are a lot of clues earlier.<br /><br />There are some nice Gore effects in the werewolf victims, but it's never on a 'Braindead' level, so it always looks realistic, while Bridgets transformation is as great as Gingers in the first 1, kinda reminding of The Fly, not the original but the gory remake.<br /><br />overall together with the first one my favorite part, i mean normally i'm not a fan of little girls in movies, and i hate it most if the director wants to force you into still liking her after she killed humanity or some sort of that, like the children in 28 Weeks later who have just wiped out our world and humanity, hated them right from the beginning, while i even liked Ghost after we learned about her, i mean it's quite a feat playing at the end a little murder girl and still appearing genuinely innocent, but i think it's the way her illness makes her into believing what she does.<br /><br />overall a great horror movie, with just enough suspense and gore to never get into the way of the story, at the beginning i thought, not a movie like Halloween 2 (great movie)again, were they just systematically wipe out some sort of hospital, but then she escapes and the story goes on and on, just good old story-telling like it should be.<br /><br />TAKE THAT Saw 3-5 (part 1 and 2 had good stories, but from part 3 onwards only Gore because they hadn't really much of a story to tell.
Brigitte (Emily Perkins) destroyed the werewolf that was her sister at the end of the first movie. Now she's infected with the same virus that's slowly turning her, and she senses that another werewolf is on the prowl for her. After an encounter with the thing, she collapses in a snow bank to find herself awakening in and confined to a rehab clinic. And the werewolf is naturally still after her, while she continuously injects herself with monkshood to stave off her inevitable transformation.<br /><br />This intense and gruesome sequel is a worthy follow-up to the superb Canadian werewolf picture "Ginger Snaps". While it may not be completely satisfactory for viewers craving a high body count, it still piles on a fair bit of gore for prime visceral impact. It's got some decent chase scenes and constantly creates a feeling of utter gloom. It's not that there isn't humor, but it's largely of the dark variety, and the film-makers and cast play out their material with total conviction.<br /><br />What certainly helps is that the film looks as if it was filmed during an actual Canadian winter. Knowing full well just how cold and forbidding they can get, I believe it adds to the unrelenting atmosphere of the piece. The cinematography seems to deliberately shy away from most bright colors, and the tension is increased by the low-key but effective music score.<br /><br />There are some standout sequences. Life is clearly not easy for Brigitte; she finds that living life on her terms will come to be difficult and that she will have to make deals to get what she needs. Her late sister Ginger (the lovely Katharine Isabelle makes a welcome return appearance) appears in visions. The intelligent script draws the comparison between the curse of the werewolf and other ills of the young female demographic, and allows the film to refrain from being predictable. It gives Brigitte an offbeat young companion named "Ghost" (Tatiana Maslany) with whom she can share dialog and compare her own bleak world view; "Ghost" is a comic book addict and sees the werewolf persona as an appropriate antihero for a world beset by problems.<br /><br />One will also notice that with the possible exception of minor characters, not a single male individual on hand is sympathetic, thereby accenting the need for females to rely on each other.<br /><br />Co-starring are Janet Kidder (Margots' niece), Brendan Fletcher, and Eric Johnson, with each putting in a solid effort.<br /><br />The ending is an intriguing surprise and worth waiting for, and the film is overall a good entry in its series and a respectable addition to the canon of werewolf films.<br /><br />8/10
Another two hours of my life that I've wasted and will never get back! How did Bridgette jump from the 1700's to the 21st century? That was never even hinted at. Poorly written, plot was obvious and predictable. Who was the male werewolf following her? Other than it wanting to mate with her "WHY" was it following her? The masturbating clip was trash and needless! The only good parts to the movie was when Grandma got nervous anytime Ghost got near her. Couldn't the mental health personnel able to tell that Ghost was a seriously sick individual? How is Ghost going to deal with a werewolf in her cellar? The first Ginger was better written!
I've never seen the 1st one but this movie blows, I'm having a hard time finding something positive about this movie, well no, i will say good job on the special effects and the werewolf costume and head, whoever made those is good. now onto the crap, the two main characters Bridget and ghost. the whole time i watched this i seriously wanted to punch both of them, if it was possible i would have. especially Ghost, whom is a little too crazy for my taste, not to mention one of those people who hope will get what they deserve, in which this movie does not give. so thats a huge mistake. i was hoping shed get it for all the crap she did. o well. and whats up with the sequel, a prequel set in the 19th century with two sisters who happened to have the same names and look just like th girls in the 1st movie LIKE O M G WHAT ARE THE ODDS!!!! geeeze its like they didn't even try.
My children and I truly enjoyed this delightful movie. Even though the story line is a little predictable, the actors made it fun to watch. This is a "kid" movie. They loved the slapstick, and the predictability. The scene with Joey on the porch talking to his "dad" was my favorite. It brought tears to my eyes. That boy was very natural and sincere. My children and I thought it was cute,and a lot of fun for family entertainment.
Movie left me feeling that the accomplishments of anyone can affect everyone. Not a bad thing to teach our kids. Some critics will naysay this film, saying that it is childish and puerile. True, but it wasn't made for adults. 'Nuff said.
This man (mr. Schuch) is definitely out of character - ALL the time!<br /><br />He is well known in his hometown, The same town of Orson Wells, Don Ameche and more His humour is almost legendary as well as his compassion. And ACT, he can do this out brown paper bag. In costume he changes and then he changes back.<br /><br />But it seems that every time we see he is going to have that one chance - then snap- there goes the cutting room floor.<br /><br />I pray someday Christopher Guest sees him and make a movie just for him. For those of you unfamiliar - you are on IMDb - they have it all<br /><br />He is just like Mr. Guest in every way.
I found this to be an enjoyable and entertaining movie. As a schoolteacher, I am always glad to find something I can show my students that does not use profanity, have excessive violence, sexual content, or have other things that might be labeled objectionable. The acting is quite good, despite the fact that most of the actors are not well known. They are believable and none of them are show stealers. Particularly interesting is the way in which Joey's nemesis, Reese, goes back and forth in his views of Joey. There are enough interesting sub-plots like this to keep the viewer interested. Movies of this type seem to be increasingly difficult to come by. "One Young Hero" is truly "family-oriented" and entertains without being sugary.
This movie probably won't win any awards for acting of script but it is an excellent movie for parents to watch with their kids. It is very clean and has has a moral lesson to it. The plot is predictable but I found myself pulling for the little hero in his battle with the bad guys. This movie won't embarras you with offensive language and sexual themes. Put a bag of popcorn in the microwave and get ready for a couple of quality hours with your kids or grandkids rooting on One Small Hero.
No kid can take on twice his size...come on! I just didn't get it.The kid actually manages to save everyone from a bad guy. Normally, bad guys aren't so dumb. The way Hutch hits Baby is so fake! It was a touching movie but i didn't think it was all that if you know what I mean. I see why the kid actors haven't acted in anything else. Everyone I know hates this movie. It's hard to believe it actually made it on the air. Although I said this movie is terrible, it's not as bad as From Justin to Kelly. That was bad. I have to agree with someone else on this. The songs and hand-clapping games were nice touches. For all the future watchers of this movie, change the channel after you see a blonde kid with a baseball cap that he's wearing backwards. This is where its starts to turn terrible.
I can't understand how someone can do such thing. I don't know if it was independent movie or what. But I never saw so bad image (like every scene was "blur" or something)in a movie, even in independent ones. The script is predictable, the actors are bad acting, trying to make scenes funny. Instead they have come ridiculous. So, why did I watch it, someone can ask: because my kids (11 and 13yo) asked us to watch any movie in the TV with them. Then I suggested them to choose one. And they did! But even they didn't like it. It should be better if they had chosen other films at Nickelodeon or Disney channel that are re-run several times a week. My time wouldn't be so wasted as it was. And this movie was played at prime time on HBO Family!!!!!
I was really looking forward to seeing this one: the trailer I'd seen promised much. Even the music sounded good. Sigh. With the exception(s) of two very lyrical dream sequences, there's absolutely nothing to recommend here. HAKAIDER calls to mind the American version of the GUYVER manganime, by way of ROBOCOP (which was itself nothing more than a thinly-veiled rip-off of the 2000 A.D. strip, JUDGE DREDD). Unlike ZEIRAM (or ZEIRAM 2) or TETSUO or any of a number of other well-done live-action anime, HAKAIDER offers nothing more than the aforementioned dream sequences; the rest is sound and fury signifying absolutely nothing. A major disappointment.
This movie is a must see for any fan of "Tonkatsu" (Reflective to real life) style cinema as well as Science-fiction/action. Comparitively this movie is an unsung classic in "Tonkatsu" it has such compelling elements similar to work from Kurosawa's "Ran" and "Rashomon".As some would complain that this film is not a visual masterpiece, I would in turn ask them how much of it they have seen. There are very dynamic characters and excellent plot formation and culmination. The storyline is a very insightful view on humanity and socio-economic divisions and struggles therein. While touching these points and making an impact at doing so, the movie's elements of action and drama are of such quality that anyone can enjoy the film without struggling to get it's deeper meaning. Missing this film is an injustice to anyone who enjoys science-fiction, action, drama, and intriguing storyline. Enjoy this excellent film.
Don't get me wrong, there have been great westerns to come before Deadwood, but none of them really got it right. There is just a reality that some people aren't willing to deal that after 50 years of our history being whitewashed through film and TV, we're finally starting to see the truth. David Milch has done his research and discovered the wonderfully bizarre contradiction of languages used in the old west. Watching the cast of Deadwood converse with a combination of old world English laced with profanity straight from the gutter is incredible and feels right for the first time. Where do people think our language came from? People always want to think that they were the first to do something, when things like profanity, substance abuse and prostitution have been around since before man walked erect.<br /><br />Along with the incredible dialog and storytelling, David Milch has introduced possibly the greatest character to ever come to TV or film...Al Swearengen. Ian McShane plays Al with the same intense conviction and truth that the character himself lives by. In Al's world things are black and white and never apologizes for a second for living his life by a strict code of morals of his own making. I don't think we've ever seen a character go from crying after a mercy killing to watching a murder he orchestrated stone faced. <br /><br />This is indeed a special show that is continuing to pave the way for the facts of our history to finally be told with truth...Instead of the whitewashing we've seen our whole lives to make us feel better about ourselves.
After executing his last legally ordained job as a Montana marshal, Seth Bullock moves to a gold-mining camp known as Deadwood, where he and his partner Sol Star strike a deal with Al Swearengen, on a lot for their hardware store <br /><br />While suspicions arise that 'road agents' may have been the true perpetrators of the killing of an entire family on the Spearfish road, competition arrives for Swearengen in the form of the Bella Union, a new joint from Chicago operated by Cy Tolliver<br /><br />Deadwooda town without any laws or courtsis the center of a gold rush and is presided over by Al Swearengen, a saloon owner, and a brothel operator His showing makes two different things between the coward and the lapse of momentary fear Let him doubt those he's trusted, this camp will run red with blood<br /><br />The show centers on Seth Bullock, a young man with a powerful temper who got a lot of Hickok's qualities But being a man with an active conscience Bullock declines to accept the horrors around him<br /><br />We are rapidly introduced to most of the other important characters:<br /><br />Wild Bill Hickokan asset to any saloon, and any joint he frequentscomes to look for business opportunity and sits there, losing at poker He is the fastest gun around While his respect for Bullock grows, he commissions 'Montana' to do a review of the Garret claim...<br /><br />Cochranthe town doctor who takes heat from Al Swearengen every time one of the whores is poorly sickwas full of opinion and took the most comprehensive view when he treated the bright widow Now he doesn't feel at such perfect liberty to opine on her husband's case as he did on hers<br /><br />E.B. FarnumJudas Goat looking fellow, coyote-moving typeis Swearengen's water boy, the innkeeper of a thousand faces staring straight at extinction<br /><br />Brom Garretthe naïve city investor who had to go all his $20,000 to turn Farnum away and purchase a gold claimpursues his remedies in some other fashion <br /><br />Sophiathe little survivorcould settle who killed her people, road agents or Sioux<br /><br />Jewelborn with difficulties and hardships that got no curewants the doctor to brace her leg so her dragging it doesn't drive Swearengen crazy<br /><br />Charlie Utterwho considers himself an important hand at the freight business plays a man too loyal and honest for his own good<br /><br />Whitney Ellsworthwho saw something he shouldn't have, a man pushed off from a ridgeseemed very competent and trustworthy<br /><br />Mr. Wuthe only source of opium in the campfinds a common language with Searengen when an opium theft occurs <br /><br />Smiththe Reverend who has a distinct, clear set of moralsknows from past experience that it's a solace having friends <br /><br />Ian McShane is a joy to watch He gives a first-class performance as Al Swearengen, the oppressive boss who can order the execution of any man in the settlement with just a word McShane who runs his Gem with the help of his cronies, emits power in every order he gives<br /><br />While McShane is a marvelous villain who generates a palpable menace, Boothe is maniacally evil as Cy exuding despicable charm  Well dressed Cy is the gentleman on the outside while more cruel as Swearengen in beating, kicking, and killing<br /><br />Such a performer was found with Timothy Olyphant, very effective as a formal marshal who understands the danger of his own temperament Seth Bullock stood before Alma Garret as a married man to his brother's widow after he was killed He took their five-year-old boy as his own son<br /><br />The 4 show women that are trapped in a man's world are: Molly Parker as Mrs. Garret, the beautiful addict wife who suspects foul play She inevitably feels she's had some part in what befalls her husband; Kim Dickens as Joanie Stubbs, the very attractive solitary woman who uses to make Cy warm; Paula Malcomson as Trixie, the prostitute who must've done some fancy to keep Al from Killing her She tries to help Alma with the orphaned child while keeping her master in the dark; Robin Weigert as Calamity Jane, the sewer mouth that follows Hickok around When she confronts the greasy-haired dangerous man who pulls all the strings, she fell apart, broken and weak<br /><br />There's something powerful and moving about 'Deadwood' It's truly a drama of memorable characters, dark and ultra-violent If you love Westerns, don't miss it!
The performance of Ian McShane was unequalled in ANY category of film or stage. The fact that the Emmy's ignored his great work is ludicrous. If you haven't seen it, buy the DVD when it's released, and I'll guarantee that you'll love every single moment. This show kicks the Soprano's to the curb. Even if you don't like Westerns per se, this show will engross you. Every character is unique in their performance. David Milch has actually outdone himself here. If the language and violence are not your cup of tea, then it would be best to stay away. Otherwise, the show is one of the best productions in years. Magnificent.
Deadwood is the finest Television program of all time in my opinion. This is high praise, considering West Wing, Hill Street Blues, and LAPD Blue. Everything about this series is top notch. The sets, the lighting, the lack of music to lead your emotions with only timely exceptions. The acting is outstanding across the board. But it is the writing that puts it in the stratosphere. David Milch combines the profane with an Elizabethan, Shakespearian, dialog that defies description. It is almost otherworldly in its beauty and deep meaning. Nowhere, in TV or movies, have I found writing and characters this good. It was truly a pleasure to see where each new episode was going.<br /><br />I was deeply saddened when this show was canceled, as it seemed there should have been one or two more years left to finish the story of Deadwood and these remarkable characters. We may never see this rich a collection of both characters and actors again.<br /><br />Well done everyone involved.
Like "Six Feet Under" and "The Sopranos" before it, Deadwood is emblematic of the fact that long form, done "right," provides a far broader palette for art than dinky old "cinema" ever could. (Sorry, cinema, you were my first love, but... that was before I knew!) The depths of character, the unremitting beauty and profundity of the dialogue... This show is Shakespeare/Dickens on TV, week after week. People will CLEARly still be watching Deadwood in a hundred years -- probably still in a THOUSAND, if the species lasts that long. They will be teaching it in high school. This show never ceases to explore and challenge its vast interpersonal landscape. It shines constant and ever brightening light into the murky depths of the human soul. Watching it, the jaw drops and only continues to plummet as the seasons roll all too quickly by.
I am very disappointed that I watched all the seasons of Deadwood. Not because the show was disappointing, but because the show ended. This was a show that was 360 degrees of amazing. A show that hit that gritty side of life in a way that leaves you feeling satisfied with its honesty.<br /><br />I really feel unsatisfied with the way HBO finished Deadwood. I am not foolish enough to think that it is all about me, but after reading the web Blog's and feeling other viewers comments I know that I am not alone.<br /><br />When and if HBO ever does anything about this I will be there to pick up where Deadwood left me...
I have really enjoyed Deadwood, so much I bought the three seasons on DVD and I don't buy many DVDs. I do believe it to be the best made series ever, all aspects are spot on, and the attention to detail is fantastic. The use of language of the period is amazing, being Dickensian at moments. The acting is superb and the sets are fantastic. I don't think I have seen busier streets anywhere. It is all enthralling - BUT it just stops.<br /><br />Two more feature length shows are 'talked about' but HBO don't seem to be doing anything other than saying 'they will not be easy or cheap to make'. If you are a fan of the show please see http://savedeadwood.net/ for info on how and where to apply pressure.
When we all thought that the western had lost its appeal in our modern day and age, HBO came with a title that definitely proves otherwise. With the stunning visual imagery of a Sergio Leone flick and the sex, intrigues and violence of ''The Sopranos'', they make the genre come to live as never before. <br /><br />''Deadwood'' tells the distinctive story of a little village that strives to stay a free haven for mobsters and corruption. Big corporations, hoodlums and authority figures all want a piece of it, but local mob leader Al Sweregan ( Ian McShane ) is stopping them with his cunning tactics and violent methods. And then there is local lawman Seth Bullock ( Timothy Olyphant ) being as idealistic as bendable towards the law. Others are the emotionally damaged Calamity Jane, the sweet natured Charlie Utter, the Jewish friend of Bullock Sol Star, grieving widow with a drug addiction Alma Garret, and the whores Trixie and Joannie Stubbs. This is just a small grasp of the colorful bunch of characters that this show has to offer.<br /><br />I adore this show for being painfully raw and oddly sensitive at the same time. People aren't exactly nice to each other, but that doesn't stop unusual friendships and relationships from occurring. People are neither good or bad. Their choices are all based on the need to get things done, even if it has a negative effect on the lives of others. And sometimes there is no other option than to be cruel. This show really portrays our ambiguous nature as human beings.<br /><br />Thanks HBO, for another great show that became one of my favorites!
Absolutely superb. I don't think I've ever given anything a 10/10 before, but for a TV show, Deadwood is excellent - and given the crap we're generally subjected to on the box, absolutely outstanding. The sets, the research, the directing, the characters, the acting - all shine. And without wanting to sound gushy, the script is close to Shakespearian in its prosaic yet pragmatic tone. The juxtaposition of the grit and dirt and blood of the real 'Wild West' with formal Victorian language is genius. Even the opening credits are beautiful. It may not be everyone's cup of tea (the language and content can be a little 'strong' although entirely appropriate and in context) but anyone who's a fan of quality entertainment, shouldn't go past it.
David Milch wrote DEADWOOD like nobody else writes anything: Dictated, open-source and interactive; just-in-time inventory created nearly on-the-spot so actors and crew could barely get it executed. Nearly everyone who can read has been subjected to lessons in civics and history in which glowing images of founding fathers and inspired visionaries brought forth upon this continent a new nation... <br /><br />I think DEADWOOD is an antidote for all manner of propaganda, because it was pointedly intended to illustrate the evolution of orderly society from anarchy. It might have been set 2000 years ago at the conclusion of Republican Rome, but HBO already had something similar scheduled. So Milch turned to a more contemporary point in time in which thousands of imaginations snapped toward The Black Hills, impassioned by an American Dream of personal wealth (The Golden Rule) and beat an amoral path to get (and keep) theirs' first, in yet another time of violent transition. Custer died the day the telephone was first publicly demonstrated. Odd. <br /><br />Ironically, the rule of gold and the search for color drew damaged, self-serving anarchists together in a bizarre perversion of selfishness that came to strongly resemble civic pride and benevolent altruism. At least, that's what DEADWOOD presents to me in the form of a truly fascinating entertainment that also unmakes the familiar, laconic Hollywood Western hero, who was the self-censored product of 30s Hollywood moguls' anticipatory auto-antisemitism. <br /><br />About a year ago, David Milch presented many of his DEADWOOD intentions to an audience at M.I.T., in the form of a riveting interview. More clearly than in two seasons of DVD commentaries, he justifies his use of profanity in the series, explains his resistance to modern settings, and places the responsibility for understanding the DEADWOOD phenomenon on the audience, because the networks can't be bothered to re-educate anybody. In This class, there will be no yawning. <br /><br />Please check it out. Just drop "Milch MIT" into a search engine, and you'll be streaming the 83minute free interview in no time.
Even if your not a western fan this show might still be for you. A tale of the South Dakota gold rush, but thats only a mere background for the story. You will watch characters your grandfather always told you about like Wild Bill Hickok and Calamity Jane as well as Seth Bullock. Ian McShane who stars as Al Swearengen. After watching 3-4 episodes Ian McShane immediately rocketed to my top 5 actors merely for his role on this show. Yes this show does have a few "goofs" as you call them in vocabulary, but who cares, why be nit picky. If continuous drinking, gambling, cursing, or prostitution may offend you, then this show is definitely not for you. Give Deadwood a shot and you will be hooked, the worst part is waiting until next week for another episode. HBO has yet again created another great show.
A lifetime regimen of television westerns has left me tired of the genre, sick of the directing, bored by the low budget sets, nauseated by the trite plots and appalled by the goodie two shoes language chosen in their screenplays.<br /><br />Deadwood is something altogether different, and though, by the admission of it's director, short of being an historical treatise it is nevertheless an historical perspective I have never seen before. Instead it is more of a treatment of an historical era lent to a respect for authenticity without compromising entertainment value.<br /><br />The scripting, casts, direction and sets are astounding. It is the first television miniseries (save for the Sopranos) that leaves me wanting for more and truly sad to see a season's ending. If only they could do something to improve new season turnaround!
For some reason television has been pretty damn good recently, with CSI, The Shield, Sopranos, etc raising the bar. Yet Deadwood goes beyond all of these. The acting is amazing, the sets are realistic...but most importantly the writing is brilliant. The dialogue is unlike any on television, and because of this the show seems more realistic and engaging than any Western movie or series ever before. Ian MacShane's Swearengen is beyond brilliance...for sheer violence he is more vicious than Tony Soprano or Vic Mackey, yet Swearengen has an intelligence and foresight they both lack. The show is violent, profane...and so is life. Come on HBO, bring Deadwood back...or at least hasten the taping of the new specials.
Im a big fan of the western genre and so bias but that said Deadwood is the greatest thing since moving pictures were invented. Over the top perhaps but after a seeing a review on Charlie Brookers screenwipe I immediately bought the dvds and instantly became addicted. My only problem I have with this program is that it caused me and my friends to neglect our Uni exams. It is without doubt the most realistic portrayal of the West and sometimes this can be annoying, for instance when Wild Bill Hickock is shot dead I was furious at how easily it was done but that would be how it was. Sometimes I wish Calamity Jane was more tough as she always appears 'all talk' to me but this further adds to the complexity of each character no matter how minor. The most moving moments to me are a toss up between the confrontation between Dan Dority and doc Cochran over Sofia Metz or one single moment when Swearengen watches Reverand Smith mad ranting from the balcony with a tear in his eye. These moments for me show the versatility and complexity of Deadwood and its characters.<br /><br />Watch it! From the start!!
Deadwood makes a real stab at the real life harshness of the western life on the fringes of community. A settlement which in it's own right is an illegal venture in Native Territory; be prepared for some really BAD things to happen.<br /><br />Ian McShane makes a groundbreaking performance in this series, depicting the real life bad guy that is Al Swearengen in astonishing style, he truly is a nasty piece of work in this series.<br /><br />Not forgetting Robin Weigert as Calamity Jane, this is perhaps one of the best depictions of the "rootin' tooting'" gal. She is far more realistic in this series as a hard-hitting butch woman, unlike in previous inaccurate depictions from the glossy western of the "stunning blonde".<br /><br />This has a quality of "Tombstone" (1993 - Cosmatos) mixed with "Fistful of Dollars" (1964 - Leone) mixed with "Open Range" (2005 - Costner), but with a far more darker side to it which is perhaps only seen in "The Missing" (2003 - Ron Howard) and it goes even further into that. Random acts of violence are not rare in this series and the community is non-stop. This is perhaps the finest example of how much trouble happens when the Odyssey runs the community.<br /><br />Conventions Followed: Framing Shots, Idea's of Odyssey and Community, Guns Saddle and Horse, an "other" (in this case the Sioux).<br /><br />Conventions Broken: Women are depicted as a tool, to be used by the Deadwood community such as prostitutes or like Calamity Jane. (slightly more realistic to the life in 19th Century Western America), Community dominated by the odyssey Character, Nothing Pre-lapsarian, Almost entirely based in the community, foul language used in it's full context, immoral characters "get-away with it".<br /><br />Prepare for some Protagonist vs. Antagonist Action.
Ah, Deadwood. Not so much a television series as an opera without music, Deadwood is painted on a very broad canvas. Is it Swearengen's soliloquies to the severed head in a box? What about E. B. and his eloquent rants at fate or the bone deep brutality of Tolliver? Perhaps it's the earthy, pragmatic Trixie or Calamity Jane, who manages to be both world-weary and innocent. Maybe it's David Milch's Shakespearean language. Whatever it is, Deadwood ranks as one of the best and most unusual series in television history.<br /><br />If you are a fan of great character actors or just excellent acting in general, this is the series for you because Deadwood is all about the people. That may sound obvious, but Deadwood's brilliance comes entirely from its characters and what they have to say. You could set them on the moon and they would still fascinate.<br /><br />Noting a few of my favorites, Ian McShane has always been fabulous but what fun to see him as the foul-mouthed Al Swearengen. He dominates the town by sheer force of personality. Of course, Al is also very intelligent and frequently finds himself surrounded by idiots - a couple of said idiots wonderfully played by William Sanderson and W. Earl Brown. Powers Boothe, who excels at charismatic villains (anyone remember him as Jim Jones?) has fun with Cy Tolliver. A couple of (to me) unknowns who turn in great work are Robin Weigert as Jane and Paula Malcomson as Trixie. And then there's the Doc; Brad Dourif in a long overdue role. Garret Dillahunt, so creepy as Wolcott, needs to be careful he doesn't get type-cast  unless he really is that bent???? And John Hawkes and Gerald McRaney and Titus Welliver and . . . and . . . ! The whole cast is just wonderful.<br /><br />If you love acting and intelligent dialog and you can tolerate some of the foulest language you'll hear on television, rent the DVDs and watch this series. It is truly one of a kind.
It goes without saying now (but of course I will say) that I and many others don't merely enjoy, "love", are engrossed by, adore, are awestruck and stunned by, etc. etc. etc., the writing, the directing, the staging, the performance, the concept, the amazing dialogue and soliloquies by Al, Bullock, Jane, Doc, Farnum, Utter, et al., and on and on. If you haven't seen "Deadwood" (I find it hard to believe that anyone who has come to this site hasn't) you MUST.<br /><br />The comparisons to Shakespeare are accurate, and "Deadwood" is in the nature of that era's play cycles. The spicy, descriptive, and even florid speech is accurate in its spirit, as was Shakespeare's in his day. I am old enough to have had, and been intimidated by at close quarters for many years, a quite "proper" great-grandmother who lived and taught English on the frontier (in Nebraska in her case) - born 1867, died 1956. Her (and my genteel grandmother's, and my refined mother's) frequently used expletives included the likes of "Judas Priest"  indicating that the most dire and terrifying consequences were impending. Other invectives and exclamations similarly invoked the deity, or were inspired by classical literature, the Bible, and popular song, and are now incomprehensible to us. These have simply been "translated" for us, where necessary, or conveyed to us "as is" when they still make scatological sense today.<br /><br />This could easily be one of, if not THE, greatest accomplishment in Modern American Theatre (it IS theatrical), and even in contemporary Literature. (I predict the scripts and performances will be studied in future college-level English Lit, Theatre/Drama, and Humanities classes.) But "Deadwood" will go out with a whimper, flawed and disappointingly ended due to HBO's (and Milch's) failure to see it through as projected and called-for by its very Art.<br /><br />Though "Deadwood" has become probably the greatest experiment (note the "ex" in that word!) in TV, it will unfortunately soon pass into the world of "might have been" without a satisfactory and worthy end. As most of you likely know, the sets have been struck, and the cast and crew will not be returning (at least as of this date) for a fourth season, as had been promised and anticipated in order to bring the cycle to an appropriate close. While as a portrayal of a moment in time, time and the world continue after the show ends, no matter when that is, the end of this third season will conclude with only the vague prospect of maybe (and that's a BIG maybe!) a 2-hour movie, or maybe 2 2-hour movies, sometime in the uncommitted future.<br /><br />If you care, please register your protest with HBO. You might even look up "Save 'Deadwood'" to see what's up. Enough from minuscule me; just watch, appreciate and try to save the incredible, always amazing, phenomenon (and justly so) that is "Deadwood". Please, please, please.
This series (mini? ) is hands down the best show ever on TV. I loved "Winds of War"," War and Remembrance" , "thorn Birds" etc. But none can match this one. I have watched Season one and two twice on DVD and season three over twice as it shows in HD. I did not watch this when it started as it seemed to be vulgar and violent in the first few episodes in the bits and pieces I saw. Then in June 2006 I rented two disks from season one and I was hooked. I searched near and far to rent the shows and Then ordered the Dvds.<br /><br />By the 4th episode you are part of the story and even starting to love the "bad Guys". I do believe if a wider audience could have been exposed to this show It would be recognized for the unparalleled cinema it is. I can not imagine many of the actors being able to top this. I recommend investing in the Dvds as it will be something to watch every year or so as it is an experience not a show.
Many thanks for the producers of this show for providing intelligent adult entertainment for adults. The language is harsh but funny and for most people it will add to the enjoyment. If you have an open mind you will enjoy the bad language as part of the show (watch the scene between Al & Mr. Wu "discussing" the stolen drugs which had me roaring with laughter). Great scripts and great acting make for great entertainment and the camera work is also excellent. I have just finished watching the first series on DVD and it is easily one of the best TV series I have ever seen. Great stories all the way though. Can't wait to catch up on Series 2 & 3 on DVD.
Deadwood was a lawless mining town founded around the 1870's and located near the Black Hills of South Dakota. It played host to such legends as Calamity Jane and Wild Bill Hickok. It was a hell of a place to make your fortune. Deadwood, the HBO series, is the half-truth/half-fictional account of this town and more importantly, its rough inhabitants. Deadwood is a satisfying breath of fresh air into the neglected Western genre. Season 1 of this great series contains 12 one-hour shows and each one features compelling plots that build off each other, strong characters that look the part, and dirty locations and scenery that are spot on. Though this may be a TV show, nothing is held back! The language is obscenely vulgar (which seems to be historically accurate), violence is shocking and graphic, and the gritty atmosphere feels realistic and true to the times. That's not to say that the show doesn't have its lighter moments thoughin fact, it provides plenty of amusement. Anyway, the acting here must be acknowledged. From Timothy Olyphant as the no-nonsense Seth Bullock, to Robin Weigert as the fowl-mouthed Calamity Jane, to Ian McShane's Al Swearengen, the vicious saloon owner who more or less runs the town, they're all fantastic! Do yourself a favor, drink a few shots of whiskey and check out this enthralling, entertaining Western saga.
Have to agree with "Monumental's" rave out of Blighty, but the consensual 9.3, in view of much more "substantial" flicks and maybe even some teleseries, seems to me effusive. This David Milch oeuvre merits same, certainly, for setting and costume and the casting and acting are nonpareil throughout. But, at heart, this too is a "fable" of unrelenting stance and style and occasionally eyebrow-raising discomfitures of character and/or situation. The cussing becomes ho-hum, as intended?, but it's the facile morphings of Swearingen and Bullock from scary villain to almost-lovable reprobate and stalwart no-nonsense hero to acquiescent second-banana. In this view, Brad Dourif's "Doc" is the most consistent and audience-friendly of the lot, even if he's almost too worldly and wise, it would seem, for both period and locale. At bottom, the series is a direct peel-off from the late, great "Hill Street Blues" template, from ensemble characterizations to the true-blue "realisms" of the respective subjects and themes. Still, none of this takes away from the incredibly maintained mise-en-scene that would do credit to any filmmaker, much less mere teleseries wonks. What?, the latter are making monkeys out of the former nowadays. Oh, minor quibbles: meseems poor Calamity Jane has been overworked for comic relief sometimes, and, I would be curious for the historic citations for the likes of Mr. Wu and his pigpen. Nice designated pinch hitter though, for exotic "color"? The game's underfoot, Watson.<br /><br />Addendum: After turning cartwheels for the likes of Season 1, and even extending into Season 2, I, personally, revise my reactions halfway through the Season 3 episodes. There can be no question about the polished savvy of the creators here, indeed, their accomplishments seem all that more astonishing. But, to me, the fact of the matter is that by Season 3, "Deadwood" had become almost a parody of itself, which is to say, "high camp." I can't quite take seriously the evolutions herein, including the Earp brothers as Blackwater types, even as seasoned vets like Gerald McRaney and Brian Cox, and even Gale Harold, make you sit up and take notice despite your askance. ALL sustaining members of the ensemble cast continue to maintain their individual "roles," even Robin Weigard's? late-blooming lesbian, albeit the writers and directors have a hard time making it convincing. Someone has posted here the claim that this "Deadwood" is a dead ringer for the historic one, coming from a resident there it should matter, but, skeptic that I remain, I have to believe that it can only be "half" the "tale," entertaining and theatrical as it is. And, finally, I personally find two "racial" elements that fail to ring my bell, to wit, the characterizations of the Negro mama and stable owner, and, more to the point, that of Wu. In that last case, the writers DID ring in the verity of "heng-dai," but assembled 150 "Chinese" between Cheyenne and Deadwood? Oh, well, this IS a fable, no? And a damnably satisfying one at that. But, to me, its "history"city falls considerably short of that of its fellow stablemate telesries, "Rome," which evinces ALL the strengths and glories and less of the stagings and asides.
David Milch has done such an amazing job with Deadwood in every way. The cast is a who's who of veteran character actors that, led by Ian McShane and Kieth Caradine, are truly superior in expression and delivery. The writing is top notch (Milch may be the best dialog writer going), and weaves the facts of the real history of Deadwood Gulch (one of the last American gold rush towns) with a few imagined characters amongst the many based on actual personages to craft and pace the storytelling properly. Milch has said that the underlying theme of Deadwood is the development of order in a culture where laws do not yet exist (Deadwood is in Indian territory, and hence outside of the U.S. proper). It is set in 1877, two weeks have passed since Custer's defeat, and the new town that sprung up on the back of the gold rush is chockablock with foul mouthed characters of all types, either looking to prospect, or service those who are finding the gold. This is by far the best western I've ever encountered. There is a lot of swearing, and the violence that occurs is fairly disturbing, but in my opinion, are necessary to the authenticity of the show. 10 out of 10
It is understandable that DEADWOOD is not for every viewer, the treatment of women, children and men - regardless of size, shape and color - is often violent or at the least brutal, heartlessness abounds and a pretty picture it does not make. The only thing is, it is done so well you are impelled to watch some more, the characters so convincingly portrayed that even though a great deal of fictional license is taken in portraying historical figures, the feel and sense of the place and the people who lived there seem real. The entire production is of the highest quality no matter what aspect might be considered. And because we intuitively know that this phase of America's history is based on violence and brutality, lawlessness and heartlessness did abound and this does not fit well into the self-image that the so-called Heartland so cherishes. Despite some stiff competition, from Sopranos to Six Feet Under, there is probably no show on television which shows Americans and their sense of family and community better than Deadwood. Hopefully HBO will continue to produce such quality writing.
Western have always been a popular stable of American culture, from pulp fiction stories, to films like The Searchers, the Man With No Name Trilogy, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, The Outlaw Josey Wales, Unforgiven and The Assassination of Jesse James. HBO has also produced some of the best television ever made, The Sopranos, Oz, Rome. Deadwood is a fine addition to that list.<br /><br />Set in the years 1876 to 1878, Deadwood is set in the town of Deadwood, South Dakota. Deadwood starts off as a small camp and slowly becomes a town through the course of the show. Deadwood is a growing town with gold prospers and becomes a area of interest for businesses, politicians and criminals. The show focuses on a number of characters, the town sheriff Seth Bullock (Timothy Olyphant), his deputy Sol Star (John Hawkes), salon owner Al Swearengen (Ian McShane) and prospector/mine owner Alma Garret (Molly Parker), as well as many key supporting characters throughout the series. The series focuses conflicts within the town. In the first series the main focus the conflict between Swearengen and Bullock over Garret's gold claim, one wants to protect her, the other wants to take it off her. The second is about Deadwood's attempt to become a part of South Deadwood and with outside interests wanting to take over people's gold claims from under them. The final series is about the conflict between Deadwood's citizens with the evil George Hearst (Gerald McRaney) who wants to take control of the town, using his thugs to gain it.<br /><br />The show is bold, focusing on themes about growth of law and order, the Untied States and Democracy in a small time. Deadwood and people change with the wider world. They are looks at industrialization process with minor themes about trade unionism, the growth of politics and the benefits and disadvantages of joining the union. The show also takes an new look of the west, it was not a glamorous world, but also looks at the influence of big business and not just individuals. The show looks at crime within the town, looking at drug dealing, prostitution, gambling and gang wars. This makes for interesting and entertaining viewing. This is a refreshing look at the west, almost like the Sopranos of the nineteenth century. There are subplots, from youth crime, to homosexuality to a very good one about a psychopathic serial killer. Deadwood is the closer America has come to making a costumer drama.<br /><br />The series has excellent characters and actors playing them. Swearengen is easily the best and Ian McShane made the role and Powers Boothe as his rival. There are good guest stars like Brain Cox who plays an over the top characters and Gerald McRaney as the quiet villain. I really like Garret Dillahunt as the villainous psycho. There are good supporting characters such as Mr. Wu, the leader of the Chinese and has some great comical moments with Swearengen and Joanne Stubbs, a prostitute who questions herself.<br /><br />The show is good for the most part but it is not perfect. The first is that in the show there are so many subplots that they end up unresolved and sometimes hard to follow. It takes away a compelling viewing. The second is the main character Bullock and the actor who plays him. The character is stiff and wooden compared to most of the other characters in the series and he is too righteous for his own good. He isn't interesting. Timothy Olyphant is a very wooden, a very dull actor. The character Alma also suffer from a similar problem, but Molly Parker is a pretty decent actress.
I just finished watching all 3 seasons and for the most part I thought it was good, season 1 was great, then season 2 introduced the George Hearst situation which after building up for 2 seasons I felt was a really crap finale: I mean Hearst hired 50+ Pinkertons whilst finally getting Mrs Ellsworth to sign over her claim, so Al Swearengen sent off for reinforcements, (Mr Wu's men and Hawkeye's men) but then Hearst just up and left!!!?? I mean all that build-up, all those Pinkertons, and they just left without a single gun-shot!!!??? I feel almost cheated!! Additionally, we never did hear the results of the elections!! And was anyone else curious why they turned Wyatt Earp and his brother Morgan into total morons!? And the way Wild Bill Hickok died; with his back turned, playing Poker? What the hell? Could have made that a bit more interesting!! And the relationship between Bullock and Mrs Ellsworth, that needs resolving!! And what happened about Mrs Ellsworth's offer to E.B Farnum to buy his hotel? She didn't seem at all bothered that he didn't sell to her but did sell to Mr Hearst!? And to be honest, was all the swearing really necessary? They need to make a 4 season to answer these problems!
Deadwood is an amazing show. The only knock I could have against it is that you have to be really careful who you let watch it because it is not for family/children viewing at all. There is more swearing than I think in any other show I have ever seen, also there is nudity, sex, etc. Of course there is violence as well. The performances in this show are amazing whoever did the casting for this show hit the nail on the head with every single character they cast for. The actors are all totally believable in every role on this show. The writing is also very good it is simply a great show that mature audiences will probably really enjoy as long as they don't mind all the swearing etc. Not for everyone but great for those who can stomach the violence, swearing and so forth.
Yeah, it is sad when a show you watch ends.....but it is very different when something like this ends. Deadwood is not a TV show. Deadwood was an experience, my roommate watched an episode with me one night and he was INSTANTLY hooked.<br /><br />And he loves it just as much as I do.<br /><br />Every aspect of the series was perfect. From the setting, cast, acting, writing, and just the entire idea of what this show is. I think most people who have had the opportunity to enjoy this show would say this is maybe the most beautifully written drama since Shakespeare. The words used were just beautiful to listen to and their meaning was........full. I don't know how else to describe it. Every piece of dialogue meant something. There was no wasted chit chat, just to pass the time like other shows do (a lot). Character and plot were in constant development and ever-changing.<br /><br />Of course, the star of the show is Ian McShane. Maybe the best acting ever, easily for a Cable TV Show. OK, a brilliant lead actor, what else? Well, everyone else was superb also. I really cannot think of one bad performance. IMO the worst was Steve the Drunk, but I would still give his acting an "A".<br /><br />I love Timothy Olyphant and his character, Seth Bullock. It was not nearly as good as Ian McShane, but the character was not supposed to be that way. Olyphant did a good job because he was calm, yet you could feel the fury and rage burning inside him. It was given to the viewer, and every episode you waited for him to explode........that is drama.
Deadwood is a landmark in TV dramatisation - technically as well as logistically. It's also a superb multi-level drama and a stunningly accurate-seeming (who knows for sure?) recreation of a Gold Rush town, with layers of thought-provoking parallels to our modern political situation. The trouble with its overall excellence is that one or two faults stick out like chicken bones in a tobacco wad.<br /><br />Plot:(SPOILERS) Over the whole series there's a sense of anticlimax. Among the much-trumpeted gangs of hired guns and the convoluted human tragedies, the main baddie simply - leaves town; Swearengen decides to kill a scapegoat and that's it. We are already aware that he has a heart, so the decision not to kill Trixie is a given. While Deadwood is commendably faithful to the idea of realism in the plot most of the time, dramatically this becomes a letdown, and nor is it made clear enough why just killing Hearst wouldn't work. I anticipated a new take on a three-way gun battle, and when that didn't happen there wasn't much agonising about anything else. And there were far too many loose ends. Drama suffered here for realism's sake.<br /><br />Characters: There are some classic cameos in Deadwood: my favourites are Doc Cochran, Reverend Smith (why no website profile?) and Richardson, and Trixie is amazingly modern and three-dimensional. The character that doesn't work for me is Calamity Jane, in spite of Robin Weigert's faultless realisation of the script. I see where Milch is coming from - she's a lovable drunk, as opposed to, say, Steve the unlovable drunk - but you only have to see one photo of the actual woman to realise that they've been extremely kind in their casting. If you're going to make Calamity Jane's reason for being in it being a pioneering lesbian, she's got to be the bullest of bull dykes. Robin Weigert's just a misunderstood tomboy. Where was the realism here? I also feel that there are eventually too many characters introduced: if you left the Langrishe Theatre Group out completely it would make very little difference to the overall plot, and while Brian Cox is as good as I've ever seen him, that particular brand of scenery-chewing tends to rub off on the other actors - and it did. Powers Boothe turned from a believable rival to Al into a moustache-twirling pantomime villain, less convincing than E.B. Farnum. The two sassy soldiers at the Stirgis election were fantastically menacing; where was the menace (apart from Hearst per se) in Deadwood itself?<br /><br />Performances: The one performance that really lets Deadwood down (from an Olympian height) for me is Timothy Olyphant. He looks great, and ranges from caring husband to psycho killer beautifully. So why is it that I keep thinking he's about to burst out laughing at the wrong moment? Maybe he's just trying to hide his cute teeth, instead of baring and grinding them. He's like Roger Moore as James Bond: just too smooth. I wonder if that's why they kept giving Seth Bullock all those scars. The face-pummelling on the floor almost becomes a running gag.<br /><br />From the start, I really thought Deadwood was going to blow me away. In the end, while it sets the bar for Hi-Def TV to come, I felt it got bogged down in all that realism, and eventually stopped being a better-than-first-rate drama and became a first-rate docu-drama with a bit too much over-acting in places and far, far more cast than was well utilised. But it's a pioneering chunk of TV, best seen and heard in HD.
I'm watching the DVDs of DEADWOOD third season and it seems that somewhere near the middle or the end of season two, Milch's writing became infected with writing disease. You can usually sleep this off, but perhaps the production schedule prohibited that. <br /><br />Many people in entertainment forums marvel at Milch's writing, but it's a question of balance. Forgive the cliché, but sometimes "less is more". The Shakespeare bug bit Dave, apparently, and, no, it's not that he's trying to write like Shakespeare wrote, but he's trying, way too hard, to write GREAT--and he can't. Here and there he can, yes, but not for every character in every other line. A little greatness goes a long way. <br /><br />Something gotta give when almost everyone is speaking in their very own stilted "high-style". The scenes bog down. The flow of the story falters, and even stops. Make way for The Writing! The story even becomes predictable, because every scene is merely a vehicle for Milch-speech. You're walking along, trying to groove with the story, and you step in a sticky puddle of piddle. <br /><br />This is not how people apprehend a story, through the preciously special use of "language". People apprehend a story by identifying with its characters, perhaps in spite of the writing, and Milch's writing--like Mamet's, by the way--too often shackles the actors, and literally tries to steal the scene from them, always for the worst. The "writing", having a life of its own, eclipses the characters, that the actors have busted their guts over to bring to life. There ends up being just one character: Milch.<br /><br />Having said that, I notice the stories flow better when people other than Milch write. Plot comes first, it seems, when others write. As it should. Minus the goofy "comic relief" half-scenes, the stories are compelling, and I'm sorta sorry there won't be another season--even if I believe Deadwood is pretty much tapped out.
After hearing nothing but praise I finally got to see the first season of Deadwood. <br /><br />What struck me again and again is the awfully affected performance by Molly Parker. While the rest of the cast speak in clear tones, Molly Parker speaks in studied whispers. Her transformation from addict does not change her self-conscious and unauthentic performance. She is simply unable to deliver a line or word without constant nervous affectation.<br /><br />She is also sexless, so the "blossoming" love affair has no spark. Why anyone would think that Parker is an actor of talent is beyond me. Her performance is at odds with the rest of the reliable cast.<br /><br />I find the use of the constant swearing distracting because it is anachronistic. The odd modern swear word would have impact but it is excessive and soon becomes tiresome.<br /><br />Basically, the show is not as good as it thinks it is.
OK this film has virtually no budget for a sci-fi movie and no real stars to speak of other than Peter 'Robocop' Weller but that doesn't matter because what it does have is a good story well told. It's a shame that bigger budget sci-fi productions never seem to remember that sci-fi should be have an interesting premise and not just throw a few explosions at the screen every few minutes.<br /><br />What is on offer in Screamers is a solidly entertaining 1hr 40mins of sci fi fun, reasonable acting and a great story based on a Phillip K Dick short. The main idea of screamers is a very scary one a war that had been taken over by machines that fight on our behalf a war that can't be stopped.<br /><br />For sci-fi fans this is a must see, for everyone else it's still solidly entertaining 7/10
Screamers impressed the heck out of me. Reviews I'd read of it called it a "slasher" movie and said that it was highly derivative of other movies, such as Aliens and Blade Runner.<br /><br />In fact, I found it to be highly imaginative and original, very much in the spirit of the Philip K. Dick story that inspired it, pondering the ultimate meanings of humanity, war and technology. The scenery and story surrounding the film were both intriguing: despite the film's low budget, the director did an excellent job of constructing the devastated planet. Peter Weller and Jennifer Rubin turned in excellent performances, and the supporting cast was also quite good. Finally, every scene is shot with a real urgency to it; particularly well done are the nightmarish confrontation 2/3 of the way through the movie and the poignant and shattering ending. In short, this is a very very good movie and well worth renting. It will stay with you for quite a while.<br /><br />Before signing off, I should say something about construing one science fiction movie as a ripoff of others. Screamers had elements of its plot which can be found in other films (ie men and machines, monsters) but it blends them seamlessly into its own original story. The mere presence of identifiable elements from other films has given people ground to criticize this movie as unoriginal. By their standards, I don't think it would be possible at all to make new movies or novels or anything. These surface similarities will always be there. One can argue that the Matrix is merely an update of Socrates' cave allegory. In conclusion: ignore the critics and see Screamers!!
Screamers is a futuristic Sci-Fi Horror set on another planet, Sirius 6B. The film starts off very poorly with a narrative spoken in a robotic voice, indicating that Screamers will be no more than Z-grade garbage. Luckily, Screamers proves to be a respectable, suspense filled film that superbly displays the extremes of raw human emotions.<br /><br />Screamers always has the advantage that it was written by Philip K. Dick, the author whose stories lead to Blade Runner, Total Recall and Minority Report. Whilst Screamers is no way in the same league as these films, it is much more thought provoking and gripping than other Sci-Fi films on a similar budget. The pace at which the plot moves is extremely intense; it seizes the attention of the audience and leaves them waiting for the next scene. The relationships between each character are all very compelling; every character has their own little story which ensures Screamers does not become one dimensional.<br /><br />Peter Weller is excellent in his role as Hendrickson. I've only seen him in Robocop so it is good to know he is not simply good at playing a robot. His character is complex as he misses earth, yet has submitted to being stuck on Sirius 6B. His relationship with Jessica (Jennifer Rubin) develops wonderfully throughout the film and is a good contrast to the horror taking place. Jennifer Rubin also puts on a great performance as her character starts as a mystery and gradually opens up in to someone the audience really cares for.<br /><br />The "Screamers" are a tremendous idea as underground defence robots who adapt to produce a new, human looking batch of screamers. The sound they make is very chilling and really brings up the hairs on the back of your neck; this is greatly reflected in the characters reactions on hearing the screams. Sadly, poor stop motion effects mean it is a disappointment when it comes to seeing the screamers attack but it is not hard to overlook special effects for a good story.<br /><br />It is a shame Screamers wasn't given more budget as it had potential to be a truly great film. I don't care about special effects very much but I feel the films vision could have been realised more if there was more money in this area. Also some of the sets are poorly designed as there appears to be a lack of effort in some places. The outlook is supposed to be bleak but the director does little to emphasise this.<br /><br />Possibly the best thing about Screamers is the end. With paranoia levels reaching those in The Thing, the twist at the end is very surprising and tense. Weller and Rubin really shine in these scenes and do well to affect the audience's emotions. The script, which is good throughout, is also especially good in the final sequence.<br /><br />With more money behind it and better direction, Screamers would be a Sci-Fi classic, as it is, Screamers is an underrated, well acted, great story.
Based on a Phillip K. Dick story (the writer of "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep," which was the background for "Blade Runner") this movie delivers, but suffers because of the apparently tight budget. Some scenes in here reminded me of the original "Star Trek" episodes, where the production crew had to become quite inventive to get effects on an almost non-existing budget.<br /><br />So movies low on money have to rely on their scripts and on good actors, and "Screamers" has them both. The story and its subplots could serve for three movies and especially Peter Weller showed a superb performance here. Generally there are some weaknesses, but they can be forgiven, if you allow yourself to get into the story.<br /><br />If you have enough of FX loaded movies that cover their thin plot with a multitude of explosions, then give it a try.
Under rated, scary, yes, even creepy. I LIKE IT! I rented the DVD years ago, and look to buy it for my collection... to put next to my soldier and starship troopers dvds, no less. Petter Weller carried the movie. No doubt about it. The whiny, phsycologically scarred soldier from the NEBs was far better tolerated than Mr "Game over man!" from Aliens (bill paxton at his unusual worst). This movie deserved a better budget, but was well made within what they had. Yes, I see the static back drops... a far cry from the dynamic CG animated ones we have grown used to in recent films. However, the "Outer Limits" style of cinematogrophy worked well for me. Okay, everyone just getting up and dusting themselves off after launching a mini-nuke into their kid-infested base was unrealistic and could have been portrayed better. The David screamer caught me off guard from the beginning, I didn't suspect anything until he was shot. And the chick? classic move. The teady bear at the end was UBER CREEPY... and begs for a WELL DONE sequel... with Peter Weller... or else don't even try. Mark this as one of my favorite unsung movies. A must see for the SCI-FI afficianado.
Another highly entertaining sci-fi film based on a Philip K. Dick short story which I have subsequently read; and I agree with other reviewers that the movie is true to the story for the most part.<br /><br />Have yet to view a movie based on a Dick story that wasn't enjoyable, e.g., Blade Runner, Minority Report. If you liked either of those movies,you will enjoy this movie for its intelligent entertainment.<br /><br />Weller's character Hendricksson is fairly straight forward as a disenchanted commander believing that his command has been abandoned and that their battles on this outpost planet have been made irrelevant by the higher authorities. Consequently, Hendricksson sets out to bring a truce proposal to the enemy forces.<br /><br />But technology gone awry rears its ugly head in the form of self-manufacturing killing devices known as the screamers named for their high pitched sound just before they slice and dice humans.
Obviously most people didn't think this movie to be much anything special, although I tend to disagree. I thought this movie was probably one of the best sci-fi films in years that I've seen. Peter Weller (best known as RoboCop) is also a very under-rated actor who deserves some good roles these days. The only problem with this movie was the very poorly done special fx. I'm sure if this movie would have been given a bigger budget it would have done better in theaters.
For the few who happen to be fans of Peter Weller, this is certainly one to hang onto. A great little film that is just as brutal and vicious as any movie by Paul Verhoeven. I was surprised Verhoeven didn't direct a film like this. A little cheesy, but often times interesting, Screamers is a little film I like quite a bit. The funny thing is, I liked this film, even though I had watched Twelve Monkeys just a couple hours earlier (I did a little theater hopping). A cool little film with a freaky ending.
A well made, gritty science fiction movie, it could be lost among hundreds of other similar movies, but it has several strong points to keep it near the top. For one, the writing and directing is very solid, and it manages for the most part to avoid many sci-fi cliches, though not all of them. It does a good job of keeping you in suspense, and the landscape and look of the movie will appeal to sci-fi fans.<br /><br />If you're looking for a masterpiece, this isn't it. But if you're looking for good old fashioned post-apoc, gritty future in space sci-fi, with good suspense and special effects, then this is the movie for you. Thoroughly enjoyable, and a good ending.<br /><br />
This was a pretty faithful adaptation of Philip K. Dick's story, "The Second Variety". The only major difference is that instead of a Cold War setting on Earth, they used a corporate setting on a colony world.<br /><br />So why did this movie rock? Because they stuck to the story, which was quite a good one, of killer robots who decide to ignore their programming to attack the enemy and consider all humans the enemy, and have developed a way to replicate them in the process.<br /><br />Peter Weller, whom I don't consider a great actor, is at his best here, as a war weary commander who stumbles onto this shocking fact, as he tries to get back to his base to warn his comrades. Jennifer Rubin is pretty good as a killer android who doesn't know what she is until the climax.<br /><br />They gave it a happier ending than Dick did, but still, a solid film.
Contemporary releases in sci-fi/horror genre prove that rich Hollywood filmmakers are running out of ideas. This film is really an excellent example of how you can do a great job with almost no money.<br /><br />The greatest thing in Screamers is that there is a message in it. It's just a way the real art should be - it should make people think, dream, use their imagination and not only consume the finished and totally digested pieces of information. And I think not many expensive Hollywood productions (especially sci-fi) are successful in this regard.<br /><br />So, for instance, the idea that someone who looks human, can be a rusted dead machine inside and you can never say who's who judging from their appearance. Or the forsaken soldiers who sacrifice their lives in a pointless war, which was forgotten by the governments who started it. Blood is cheaper than raw materials - this is also reflecting the main principles of our life today.<br /><br />In my opinion you mustn't have one million explosions or world-famous stars in a movie to make it good. It's just a good story, an appropriate atmosphere and some really well done acting to make it good. And in my opinion Screamers has all these elements.
I saw this movie for the first time many years ago. I watched it by chance; after renting a Hollywood box office action film. I had two movies that I wanted to rent, but the 2nd movie was out. So I browsed the movies and picked this one since it had an interesting name & Peter Weller was in it. Screamers was a last choice rental. I'm glad I rented this movie, it was a lot better than the box office movies I rented. True this movie has a very low budget but thats what makes it great. It has the great sorta feel of (John Carpenter's The Thing). Its a desolete kind of movie. The acting in this movie is good, especially by Peter Weller. This movie is about the morality of machines made by man to fight other men, and then all of man fighting evolving machines that want to be like man, that use mans weaknesses against man. The premise is very intelligent, and the amount of action is perfect for the story to unfold. This movie will make you think! Well, It made me think. This movie is quite entertaining and is one of my all time favorites. It could of been improved a little bit but only by the supporting casts acting. If this movie had a large or very large budget, it would have been made for larger group of the masses, and therefore it would have sucked! If you like sci-fi this is a must see! or addiction for any collection.
Set in the distance future and in a place far far away, Screamers is an excellent sci-fi flick about two warring entities whom both have been long since forgotten. For the past 10 years, Sirius 6B has been shaped by the face of nuclear war and now it will be shaped by a another, more smarter, and aggressive entity called a Screamer. A Screamer was a man-made robot (sent to help one side) complete with an advanced A.I. who lurks beneath the ground waiting for its prey. Waiting silently and patiently. But little do both sides know that this man-made robot has got a few tricks up its own sleeve. Screamers is a amazing movie that features lots of suspense, plot turns, and a few good comedy scenes of its own. If you enjoyed Pitch Black or Red Planet, this is a great movie to add to your collection.
For you complaining about woody acting: this is not a bug, it is a feature. It makes sense the same way it makes sense that the type three is not attacked by the screamers, when you understand what it really is.<br /><br />All these droids and their characters are artificial. Their characters are designed.<br /><br />The machines who designed them have read some Shakespeare, it seems, and watched stereotypical American warrior stories.<br /><br />Get it? It is crappy, but it is meta crappy. Like in Total Recall you are looking at traces of someone else's story within the story.
This is an excellent scifi. The genre is usually dominated by "touchy-feely" stories which have men exposing their soft gooey center, or "horror" stories which have men exposing their soft gooey center. In either case man is shredded into little pieces for the audiences pleasure. I find both of these types to not be "scifi" I think of them as "fantasy with the watchable part being scifi."<br /><br />This movie avoids the pitfalls of femininazation and horrorization (is that redundant? :) and instead remains true to the original intent of the genre' - a true scifi. 9/10<br /><br />I found the ending annoying, which if cut would push this movie up to 9.5/10. But half-a-point does not ruin this movie at all. If you like *REAL* scifi's, like this one, then also see the movie version of "Lost in Space."<br /><br />-Zafoid<br /><br />PS: Kudos to the special effects. They were absolutely brilliant - from equipment to backdrops and the robotics!<br /><br />-Z
On a desolate planet, two factions are at war with each other, but there is another menace out there tunneling beneath the ground. An 'autonomous mobile sword', or screamer, is an incredibly quick weapon named for its high-pitched shrieking, and which cuts its victims into pieces. It turns out, these weapons seem to be evolving on their own, and become capable of taking on new forms.<br /><br />Based on a Philip K. Dick novel (his works have also inspired the films "Blade Runner" and "Total Recall"), this is better than your run-of-the-mill, filmed-in-Canada B-movie. Slowly, deliberately paced, dialog heavy, subtle, and atmospheric, it's rewarding for those who stick with it. It looks quite impressive - special effects are excellent, rarely ever getting overtly cheesy - and the indoor / outdoor sets and location work are phenomenal. The snowy, windswept landscape is photographed quite well. Overall, it's quite a nice film to look at.<br /><br />Co-scripted by Dan O'Bannon of "Alien" fame, that gives it some extra punch, as he always tends to do quite well in the realm of science-fiction. The acting is good - Peter Weller is a stalwart, and refreshingly, not one-note, hero, and is supported capably by Roy Dupuis ("The Rocket"), Andy Lauer, and the lovely Jennifer Rubin ("A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors", "Bad Dreams"). Some of the characters are abrasive, although that thankfully never became too much of a distraction. The story twists are actually not ones that really surprised me, but I appreciated the story-telling in general.<br /><br />"Screamers" *is* a nice little surprise, worth looking into for science-fiction buffs who have yet to see it. It's bleak, chilly, interesting, and reasonably entertaining stuff. I recommend it.<br /><br />7/10
Really, I mean that this is a self-contained movie; it sets up a premise, a backdrop, characters... and manages to deliver. The grainy/gritty look of this film is really commendable, and instead of just saying "Killer robots!" and putting it on autopilot the filmmakers kept throwing little bits and pieces of creativity out there. Peter Weller is perfect for his role and develops great repartee with the greenie who tags along with him to... some pretty nice matte paintings. Budgetary constraints aside the movie looks good, the spaceships look good, the robots look good, and this is simply the kind of unified enterprise that doesn't get made with $100,000,000 and Bruckheimer producing (what is it with the Germans? I mean, Devlin and Emmerich and Bruckheimer?). So watch it, it's enjoyable and competent until the last 15 minutes.
I believe the original story that this film is based on is called "Second Variety", a great post-apocalyptic novel by Sci-fi meister Philip K. Dick. The film captures some of the terror from the original story, but director Christian Duguay and storywriter Dan OBannon fails to deliver the film that this had the potential to become. Philip K. Dick's stories adapted to film have previously been great successes, like "Blade Runner" and "Total Recall". So why Duguay and OBannon chose to rewrite the ending completely into one of the worst cases of "Hollywood Happy Ending" I've ever seen, and in doing so completely removing the the ENTIRE plot of the original story, leaves me a bit provoked.<br /><br />My vote: 4 out of 10
This movie starts off well. When the guy comes to the main characters base with that scrool then he is chopped up by the screamers. The plot also starts of well. Little ground digging (like miniature versions of those things in "Tremors") robots are used for war, and guys on the same side as them wear wrist bands that let the screamers know they are of the same side. The people in the base have to smoke some red cigarettes to protect their lungs from something in the air "We have to protect our lungs from sh*t by putting sh*t in them". But this movie gets bad in a hurry. We really want to turn it off when those kids (screamers in kids bodys) are walking and the main characters going "help me". But some decent special effects and ok atmostphere let me give this film 6/10.
----SPOILERS INCLUDED---- not that it matters for such a horrible film, though...<br /><br />Carnivorous robots in outer space that self-mutate and multiply underground before annihilating everyone on a forgotten planet in the future... does it sound like the recipe for a REAL turkey? Well, surprise, surprise: it is.<br /><br />It's hard to even begin shredding this unwitting parody of a horror sci-fi. Maybe they should let some of those "screamers" do the job instead: let them loose on the original reels. Good riddance. And take the script too, as you go; if you can find one, that is. <br /><br />Don't worry about the writers and producers; this film was probably the result of some alien self-mutating process deep down some forgotten Hollywood vault anyway. Oh, help us if these films start self-multiplying as well.<br /><br />OK, Peter Weller is decent, that's one star. The rest? Hrm. A clue: don't waste money renting this film to find out.<br /><br />If you're easily thrilled/scared by little lumps of unused screenplay crumpled up and dragged by string under a sand surface, then this is for you.<br /><br />If not, you'll agree that the title "Screamers" probably was inspired by the envisioning of hordes of horrified moviegoers stampeding out of theatres, panicking at the thought of having spent any money on this crap. Now there's a sight that would probably have made a better horror movie, but that's beside the point.<br /><br />Thank IMDb that there is a site like this to warn other people about wasting parts of their precious lives on this garbage.<br /><br />FINAL GRADE: Epically bad.
I am still amused and confused why this stinker ever made it to the theater. The poor plot and nonexistent story made this one of the worst movie going experiences that you could waste money seeing. It has all the look and acting of a really poor direct to video feature.
If you ever, God forbid, think of renting this movie, DON'T. It is the worst, most boring piece of trash I have ever seen. I was ready to shoot myself ten minutes into this so called 'movie'. Do not watch this movie, EVER!!! If you are with friends and they all agree to watch this movie, do EVERYTHING you can to escape!!
I saw this film years ago, when it first came out at the cinema. Even after the first 10 minutes I found myself laughing at the apparently serious film. The special effects were bad - with the exception of a computer generated sequence at the end of the film, and the melting plasticine woman was good too...hmm. The low budget was especially visible when a Microsoft® Natual Keyboard is seen in the film, obviously a high-tech computer would need one. If you have nothing better to do and love anything sci-fi then watch it - you might get a laugh out of it.
No plot. No dialogue. One decent actor (Peter Weller, who's probably trying to forget his involvement). Zero redeeming qualities. Lots and lots of pointless walking through wastelands. Special effects that make the Dr. Who folks envious. Do yourself a favor, don't watch this film. Please.
Seen it years ago when it came out to rent and again this year on DVD, it is a good film but still in the straight to video bunch of films, some FX are really good for such a film and some are not so hot but it has been done to the best of there budget which has not been much, any weak parts are made up by a good story one i would like to have seen run another 20 mins or more as it seems to end just as its getting in full swing, this is all down to budget mind, if the film had more money, bit more gritty. bit more spent on FX, better lighting, more depth on story, then who knows this could of been a very very good film to push other films such as ALIEN and others, but as it is 7 out of 10
Woah... I saw it in 1996 in a theater near my small Provençal village, and i simply wasn't expecting that... Christian Duguay proved once again he was terribly underrated by both the press and the public, "Screamers" ("Planète Hurlante" in France i/e "Screaming Planet", nice title too...) is the B-side at its best, the B-efficiency with an almost-A script. The cast is OK (Roy Dupuis was almost a star here in the early 90s, the VFX impressive (for the most of them), and - as some viewers wrote earlier - the first part very promising. Overall, a good job. Take it on video with a couple of friends, some chips'n'soda (ok, beer if ya want).
Thats right. Those small kid robot things. Uhhhhhh *shudders*.<br /><br />Anyway, a good sci-fi flick that sometimes a bit cheesy but otherwise it dosen't let you down as far as action and suspense goes. Christian Duguay, Dan O'Bannon and Philip K. Dick did a fair job at a movie that has a decent jab at the sci-fo genre. Although one of the lesser sci-fis(in my opinion) the storyline would have to be one of the best and the characters fit in perfectly. Peter Weller does a splendid job as Hendricksson. His acting performance is probably up there with his robocop one and it probably lifted his career to new heights. Special effects impress for 1995, as this helps lift 'Screamers' to new heights. A good movie for anyone who wants a creepy sci-fi. <br /><br />Overall: 70%
Stories by Philip K. Dick always get transformed into good science fiction films. First there was Blade Runner, then came Total Recall and now we have Screamers.<br /><br />Screamers is fairly low-budgeted (I think around 10 - 12 million dollars), but it is really, really good. The script is ace because its written by Dan O'Bannon (Alien, Total Recall), and the director knows exactly what he's doing. It stars Peter Weller (from RoboCop), and he really shines as an actor in this film. Andy Lauer, who plays the rookie who is ironically nicknamed Ace, is also very good, as are Roy Dupois who plays the mysterious Becker, and Jennifer Rubin who plays Jessica.<br /><br />The story is interesting and has a sense of paranoia, because you never know who is a Screamer (a killer robot), and who isn't. The futuristic sets of a war-ravaged planet are also excellent, and the costumes and props to go with it are good too.<br /><br />The only thing that lets it down are the special effects. For some parts they are ok, like the spaceship taking off at the end. But the rest are not so good, such as the stop-motion Screamers that are outdated and when Becker gets shot in half.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a very good movie. If it had a slightly higher budget to sort out those special effects it would get full marks, but as it is I give it 8/10.
I'm a big fan of Philip K. Dick, and so I already knew the basic story behind Screamers. (it was based on a short story of his). On seeing the film, I was satisfied with the way that they managed to work around the original's cold war trappings. Also, despite the low budget, the effects were sufficiently good to suspend disbelief. In fact, the attention to detail (surroundings, back-ground, odd gadgets etc.) was excellent, as is important in all sci-fi films...by creating a coherent world, the movie becomes that much more convincing. The performances were excellent, for such a low budget, and some of the lines were very quotable (up there with the script of 'Aliens' if you ask me). This is always an advantage. However, right at the end, I felt a little let down by the love-scene. It kind of destroyed Philip k. Dick's 'message'. Nevertheless, I managed to overlook that, considering how much fun it was.<br /><br />This film is no classic, but it's well worth a look. It's really quite good!
The Shakespearean references and underlying philosophical "being and becoming" themes involving machine and human nature, elevate this above average Sci-Fi film to the "next level". Not as classic a film as the existential "Blade Runner" but worthwhile nevertheless.
What a terrible movie, every thing about this movie makes me want to take a shower to wash off the filth! The mistakes in this movie are too much for one to handle. For some reason when they parachute from the Hercules in the beginning and hit water it changes from day to night in under 30 seconds and some how they have rubber dingies with huge boat engines that someone had to have had in they're pocket and blew up, because is isn't visible that anyone had any packages when the dove out from the plane. then when they hit land, for some reason they dress up as hobo's while they're still carrying around M4's and Ak's, while trying to be under cover.This is soon followed by the Rangers wandering around the streets taking they're hobo-taskic costumes off, after they only had them on for about 3 minutes, you can't blame them, this film is such a steaming pile of crap I would've refused to dress like a jack-ass. When Joe-Joe dies, and his eyes are about to be closed, you can see that his eyes are closed to begin with. Matt Macoy then shows off his ability to shoot guns while blinking like a mad man. Matt Macoy dosen't even look like someone who'd be in the military, he looks like that substitute teacher who would always try to control you class and yell ' Guys....Guys...Guys comon'.....Guys....comon'guys...' and all you can do is laugh at him as you jump on you desk and shoot spitballs at him. Then you can see a guy who looks like Mister T on a different vehicle in a scene, then in the next scene he's on a different vehicle and then back on the first vehicle. I also never realized that you can shoot a bazooka at someone 10 feet away and nothing will happen to you, and that some people can throw a grenade and it will blow up instantly with a 30 foot high explosion. Also, its great to have a 9mm pistol that can hold up to 40 rounds and can take out 4 car tires in one shot. And the random goons who storm the office building shooting at papers on desks is pretty cool, if you like random goons who shoot at paper on desks that is. Also if your going to take on the U.S. army, there's no better way to do it with 65 guys that look like they shop at the G.A.P., gather them all up, buy a couple dingies, illegally enter America on these dingies, grab a couple of U-Haul vans and go to some building with a whole bunch of barricades around it and start shooting at desks. The icing on this crap-fest is the highly intense bus chase, because there is nothing more exiting than two buses driving in circles. If you want to waste 90 minutes of your life watch this, but I suggest you do it with some friends, one man can't take on the dark forces of this movie alone.
The TV guide described this as " Fast and furious " , well I`d describe this film as diahorrea because it`s fast and furious faeces . I wasn`t expecting it to be up to much but I was shocked as to what a poor film RANGERS is<br /><br />****** POSSIBLE SPOILERS ******* But don`t worry you won`t want to see this movie<br /><br />The film starts with an airborne shot of a hercules C-130 then it cuts to the interior of the plane - Which in no way resembles a C-130 , It resembles a gym changing room ! - where we`re introduced to the characters in some of the most painful exposition I`ve seen of having the leader discuss what the mission is and why they`re all wearing Syrian army uniforms.<br /><br />Cut to some stock footage of men skydiving from a plane at dawn and then landing into the sea where they inflate a couple of rubber dingys underwater then cut to them resurfacing where it`s pitch black ! Some team of special forces if it takes them all day to inflate a couple of dingys . And wouldn`t the delta force or navy SEALS be doing this sort of stuff ? I`m just kind of curious why this film is called RANGERS ?<br /><br />So they carry on with their mission which confused me because if they`re posing as Syrians then that can only mean the action is taking place in Syria or the Lebanon ,neither country being at war so why`s this taking place in the middle of a war zone ? It gets worse though because one of the team says :<br /><br />" This jobs easier than that twenty buck hoe I had in Las Vegas "<br /><br />Yup there`s nothing more endearing to an audience than knowing one of the heroes has to pay for sex . In fact would a prostitute in Vegas be charging as little as twenty bucks ? Shows you how bad a film like RANGERS is when you find yourself asking questions like that .<br /><br />Enough . I could spend several pages writing about this piece of garbage but it`s not worth it . It`s a cheap straight to video film composed of stock footage and a bunch of non actors giving the impression they`re making the story up as they go along . I won`t finish on the old cliche that I wasted ninety minutes of my life on this crap because I only wasted thirty minutes of my life on it as I turned it off when the guy got blown out of the window
Matt McCoy stars as Scott,a Navy Seal who is the target of wrath of Shannon (Glenn Plummer) who thinks Scott sold him out, he didn't but that doesn't stop Shannon from abducting Scott's wife, or blowing up various figures in the pentagon, once again absurd plot twists come up and the flick rips off many action sequences to give it a more explosive look in this terrible yet funny movie. Where do I even start with this one? Well for one the whole commentary in which Wynorski keeps referring to the footage stolen as Delta Force 2, but it's actually Delta Force 1! Other such action sequences are from Red Heat,Invasion USA and Navy Seals. Rangers is utterly absurd with acting so wooden, action sequences so obviously lifted and plot angles so over the top ridiculous that you cannot believe they are serious. For instance the guy (footage necessary from Invasion USA) blows up his friend's house, not even knowing that his friend wasn't in on it? Or how the government don't do anything to stop this guy after he blew up the pentagon, jeez how dense are these guys? It gets even funnier if you pretend that McCoy is playing his Police Academy or Seinfeld character. However let me just conclude this is as hilarious as terrible movies get.<br /><br />1/2* Out of 4-(Awful)
But it was very efficient by recycling action scenes and stock footage from other knuckleheaded action movies. Especially silly was the ripping off the beach landing and final battle scenes from "Invasion USA". Really, terrorists are supposed to be stealthy, not stupid using WWll vintage landing craft.
<br /><br />Hilarious. Priceless. Terrible. These are three of the many single words that I would use to illustrate "Rangers", one of those action pictures that seem to run on cable at around 10 at night. One of those films where it looks like many of the action scenes were shot in the director's backyard and several scenes look like stock footage. After a title sequence that looks wonderfully 80's, we're launched into the story itself A group of commandos is sent to bring back a terrorist from an unnamed country, but find out that the group knows they're on the way. After a few remaining members barely make it out, they find out that they'd been set-up, or something like that. One of their rangers they thought they'd left behind is actually working for the bad guys and suddenly comes back looking for revenge. Every other line is some other variation on, "you have no idea what I've been through!" or "the mission! We must not forget the mission!". Every action-movie cliche is spoken at some point throughout the film - but what makes it occasionally unintentionally hilarious is the straight-faced, wooden acting that attempts to take every single like incredibly serious. Ok, so there are occasionally some decent production values (a few respectable explosions), but as with all of these low-budget action films, the script seems to have been made up along the way. Obviously, these films don't cost a great deal and can end up being bought for cable or home video release (as Fox has done with this film and the equally terrible monster picture "Python"). The storyline almost doesn't even matter in a film like this one (nor do a few continuity errors) - the movie simply attempts several old-school, low-budget action sequences (according to the commentary, apparently some bits of the final action sequences are new, but many are actually cut in from a different, old action movie altogether). Corbin Bernsen receives top billing for, according to the commentary, three hours of work. The director and the main actor discuss their work on the film's commentary track and thankfully seem fully aware what they've created.
This supposed action pic should be marketed as a comedy. Of errors that is. Wooden acting, a ridiculous plot, and numerous continuity errors could be over looked if you watch this as a laff packed action fest. Right from the get go you know your in la la land when the rangers jump out of a Hercules transport at dawn somewhere over the mideast, but then after a water landing they surface in the dark! The continuity errors continue throuout the pic, costumes and make up change multiple times within scenes. But ya know what, it does'nt matter! The script is even more ludicrous. After the Rangers capture a terrorist and bring him to the USA the bad guys do a night landing of several hundred baddies on a FL beach using WW2 landing craft! Yuh Right!<br /><br />All this does'nt matter if you view this as a 6 pack comedy! You get paratrooper fu! Our favorite 90's [and new millennium!] bad guys, the typical Hollywood Arab idiots, and best of all, a duelling bus-fu chase to top it all off! I love bus chases... esp. when trains are involved!
One of the weaker entries in the Drummond series, but it's still entertaining. Perhaps I've seen too many of the Drummond films too close together. The humor is not as sharp as earlier entries. The pacing is fine, but the plot and villains don't seem to be up to snuff. The villains don't appear evil or sharp enough to harm a fly, let alone our hero.<br /><br />There is a nice sequence of that wonderful 30s "lab equipment" working its magic. So much more exciting and dramatic than computer chips and LEDs! Now that's evil!
This entry begins with another wedding about to take place. One of the gifts is a huge diamond, brought by Algy, and created by his father in law. It turns out that he has a process for making diamonds for as cheap as a shilling each. This, of course, would upset the balance of trade and the diamond industry would be destroyed. He still wants credit for his findings, but it brings a whole host of bad people into the mix. The best scene is Tenny riding a motorcycle and crawling onto a moving car. He, of course, is the best character in all of the movies I've seen, and once again is called on to fix things. There are murders. There are notes destroyed. The whole state of the world's economy is never really taken care of. Ours is not to worry about such things, I guess. There are several cases of mistaken identity which makes this a lot of fun.
Another trip to the altar for Bulldog Drummond is averted when at a pre-wedding gathering in Switzerland a Swiss detective is murdered and an artificial diamond, courtesy of its inventor Halliwell Hobbes to bride and groom John Howard and Louise Campbell. That sets off a round of a little over an hour of fast paced adventure as Drummond once again shows up Scotland Yard.<br /><br />Bulldog Drummond's Peril steps into the realm of science fiction with Halliwell Hobbes inventing a machine that can create diamonds, a process we know takes millions of years of geologic pressure. The gizmo he has looks like it was made from spare parts in Dr. Frankenstein's laboratory.<br /><br />The film is blessed with two villains, industrialist Matthew Boulton and rival scientist Porter Hall both of whom want to get their hands on that formula and profit off it in some way. One way that wasn't even considered was that very few diamonds are used as jewelry. The majority are industrial strength and used for things like oil drill bits. A way to manufacture those babies on the cheap would yield someone a lot of money.<br /><br />John Barrymore plays the Scotland Yard inspector and by dint of his name is top billed over John Howard as Drummond. It's a sad come down for Barrymore who reminds me of J.D. Cannon as Chief Clifford in the McCloud series, the way Drummond constantly shows up the Yard. He also has a little bit of Perry White thrown in as he constantly is telling people 'don't call me inspector'.<br /><br />The science is a bit bizarre and the plot has way too many holes in it. If you're expecting something as good as when Ronald Colman was Bulldog Drummond, you won't find it here.
Preview: Summary: This one has a trained penguin<br /><br />This is the twelfth Bulldog Drummond film, the third starring John Howard as Drummond, and the second based on Sapper's novel 'The Third Round' (the first version of which was the silent film of 1925 'Bulldog Drummond's Third Round' starring Jack Buchanan, of which one print is said to survive in an archive). This one is tauter and more dramatic than most because it was edited by Ed Dymtryk. John Hogan also did a fine job of directing, with many dramatic angles and more closeups than were seen in the previous Drummond film by another director. There is interesting second unit material of London. The budget for this film was fairly ambitious, more so than in later efforts. Louise Campbell and Nydia Westman, the two irritating women, are kept under control and their roles minimized, to my great relief, and to the improvement of the drama. The lead billing once again is given to John Barrymore, who plays the Commissioner, but in this film, he acts up a storm and has many strong scenes, unlike the previous offering, 'Bulldog Drummond's Revenge', in which he sleep-walked through the story. So in this one, he really earned his fee for a change. The wonderful character actress Zeffie Tilbury here plays an amusing housekeeper who puts policemen in their place with the best East End cockney applomb, and takes no nonsense. Hogan, having just directed her in 'Scandal Street' (1938), evidently was responsible for introducing Elizabeth Patterson to the series, as a hysterical Aunt Blanche. Porter Hall puts in another of his villainous appearances, to excellent effect. (Villains are always so much more menacing when they speak quietly, as he does.) There are some amazing laboratory scenes in this film, reminiscent of Tesla, with surging electric currents and so forth, and one half expects a Frankenstein monster to appear. The story is about the manufacture of artificial diamonds, of the need to protect the diamond industry and, as Barrymore admits, to protect the Empire, from the threat of being able to make diamonds 'become as cheap as pebbles' and 'to be larger than the crown jewels'. Naturally, there is scope for villains galore with such a scenario. There is lots of action, plenty of train, car and motorbike chases, climbing up walls, and in this one, E. E. Clive as Tenny the gentleman's gentleman has the most energetic and active of all his Drummond roles, and hijacks a truck at gunpoint, hanging upside down from the roof. But most ingenious of all is the cute trained penguin who has more scenes than Louise Campbell and is a finer bird. Watch him hop and squawk, dear little thing. He also discovers a corpse under the table, which was a fine feathered deed worthy of this fast-moving film, which does not disappoint any stout Drummondonian.
An MGM PETE SMITH Short Subject.<br /><br />A very silly housewife receives help with her dinner MENU - and a cure for her hubby's upset tummy - when a chef magically arrives in her kitchen.<br /><br />This fanciful little film is an enjoyable bit of early Technicolor fluff. The practical demonstrations, mixed up with the gentle humor, serve up a most pleasing result - almost as appetizing as the roast duck & baked apples. Movie mavens will recognize Franklin Pangborn as the dyspeptic husband, Una Merkel as his featherbrained wife, and Luis Alberni as the remarkable chef, all uncredited.<br /><br />Off-the-wall narrator Pete Smith would produce a reworked version of this story - with Oscar winning results - four years later in PENNY WISDOM (1937).<br /><br />Often overlooked or neglected today, the one and two-reel short subjects were useful to the Studios as important training grounds for new or burgeoning talents, both in front & behind the camera. The dynamics for creating a successful short subject was completely different from that of a feature length film, something akin to writing a topnotch short story rather than a novel. Economical to produce in terms of both budget & schedule and capable of portraying a wide range of material, short subjects were the perfect complement to the Studios' feature films.
I love these little "one reel wonders" that TCM throws in at the end of their regularly scheduled movies as filler till the next movie comes on. I caught this one at the end of Sunrise, during TCM's 31 Days of Oscar. Seems this little 1933 one-reeler was nominated for Best Short Subject.<br /><br />It's very amusing. An early technicolor about a man with indigestion, thanks to a wife who's a klutzenheimer in the kitchen. Una Merkel plays the dippy wife -- she utters about 3 words but is told by the unseen narrator that he's the only one allowed to talk! The narrator acts as an omnipotent overseer, putting broken eggs and spilled condiments back together again by the magic of reverse-action filming. He also brings in a chef in a puff of smoke, to come to the housewife's rescue. We are then treated to a mini-cooking show, with instructions on how to prepare stuffed duck and baked apples. It's quite droll, with the narrator getting off such funny zingers as: <br /><br />"Cook the stuffing for 15 minutes, for that perfect taste that you love to burp up later." <br /><br />"Now clutch the apple firmly so it will realize the futility of any resistance." <br /><br />Very funny and amusing. Too bad there's no way to actually know when this will be on again. I don't think TCM lists its one-reel wonders in its programming guide, which is too bad. Well, if you run across "The Menu" at the end of your regularly scheduled program, be sure to stick around and watch it. I think you'll enjoy it!
Menu---The Burp of a Nation---8/10.<br /><br />This little ditty shows up occasionally on TCM, so you might be lucky, as I was, to accidentally run across it in the ending minutes of a Tivo recording of a classic movie. The running time states that it is 10 minutes in length, but it seems much shorter than that. <br /><br />The short centers on a housewife and her feeble attempts at cooking. Her kitchen is in a shambles; everything she touches produces a sound effect and a wise crack from an omnipotent narrator (Pete Smith). Away from home, the husband sits in his office worrying about what his wife will be concocting in the kitchen for his consumption when he gets home. Meanwhile, at the office, his belly is aching, so he is never far from his bicarbonate of soda, which he keeps in his jacket pocket.<br /><br />The narrator keeps everything moving along very nicely as he throws in one liners, puns and wry observations of the hapless couple. The narrator also punctuates the proceedings by not only dropping in many appropriate sound effects, but also by bringing to life a chef to manage the wife's dinner arrangements. In a puff of smoke the chef enters into the kitchen and proceeds to teach the wife how to stuff a duck and bake some apples.<br /><br />When the husband comes home, the chef has disappeared and so has the husband's bicarbonate. The husband has a meal fit for a king, but he'll only be king for a day, I don't think this wife could make a bowl of cereal.<br /><br />After watching this short, I thought it was made sometime during the 1940's, but was completely shocked to see (while on IMDb) a release date of 1933. I didn't know they used color as early as that.<br /><br />Very short, very tasty and easily digestible. 8/10.<br /><br />Clark Richards
