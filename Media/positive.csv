"1","10","For far too long, history has condensed the story of the Viking people into a comic book saga filled with primitive characters raping, plundering, and wearing funny horns, breastplates, and flaxen braids. Thanks to the History Channel, we have the opportunity to appreciate an engaging, well-acted, fairly accurate picture of these intelligent, spiritual, self-disciplined, and hardy craftsmen, clansmen, and seafarers whose skills and civilization in the 8th and 9th centuries was more advanced than that of much of the European continent. Consummate shipbuilders and navigators, Vikings managed to traverse the deadly seas of the North Atlantic (in open longboats!) to discover North America centuries before Christopher Columbus was even born. They settled much of Ireland, England, Greenland, Russia, and Iceland. The Norsemen didn't manage to accomplish all that they did by being rage-filled, crude, undisciplined savages. This show capably demonstrates the high degree of cooperation among their clan, the rules that governed their communities, their work ethic and egalitarian spirit, strong sense of loyalty, and the abiding sense of justice that is still deep, deep in the Scandanavian DNA right up to today.
During the first millenium, there was lively trade between Scandanavia and Germany, Spain, what is now Russia, and even North Africa. Norsemen were justifiably famous for their craftsmanship in building homes, barns, and other dwellings, for painting and needlework, and in fashioning arts from silver and pewter. They were a spiritual people, as this show depicts, and although their pantheon of gods may seem childish and naive to those of us reared in Judeo-Christian traditions, the Norsemen lived by a spiritual code, believed in an afterlife, and called upon God as they understood Him/Her to protect them and guide them in this life.
Not only does the plot of The Vikings keep us engaged from week to week, the casting is just superb. Travis Fimell dominates the screen as Ragnar, one of the most revered Norse heroes of history. He is perfectly cast and his is a breakout performance. His wife, a Shield Maiden, Lagertha, is played by Kathryn Winnick, again a stroke of casting genius. She manages to combine the nurturing Earth Mother presence with a fierce warrior spirit [much admired in Norse legends] and genuine sexual heat with her husband. Other characters, including Gabriel Byrne, Gustaf Skarsgard etc are equally adept.
I have become a huge fan of this well-plotted and well-acted series and hope that the History Channel powers that be will continue the saga into future seasons.",
"2","10","Michael Hirst is a brilliant story teller and historian. He does his homework and then some to bring these Viking people to life on the History Channel. Travis Fimmel, Katheryn Winnick, & Clive Standen do a brilliant job in making you feel like you know them . . . the curious people who want to see more of the world in any ways they can. The treasure they bring back from their trips is not your typical trinkets. They bring back slaves and make them apart of their people/clan. What they do while on your trips is most disturbing, but each actor makes you want to keep watching to see what else happens. I had to have a few talks with myself while watching this season. The bloody raids, the hard punishment their king gives to their own people, and the like is very graphic and brutal. Travis, Clive, Kathryn, George, Gustaf, and massive cast bring what Michael Hirst has envisioned to life so we the audience have a better understanding what it was like back in the 800 hundreds. I look forward to purchasing S2, S3, S4 and watching S5 this fall.
Travis Fimmel is the perfect leading man for this series. His acting has improved so much over the years. I am so sad to see the TV show "The Beast" with Fimmel and Patrick Swayze come to an end in the spring of 2009. After battling cancer, Swayze died later that year (September) ... in my opinion the show would NOT be the same without Patrick. The two men did an excellent job kicking "bad guy" butt in the 13 episodes in S1. So glad to see Fimmel get another shot at a multiple season show in order to show us, the audience, how much range he is able to do as an actor. Long Live the Vikings!",
"3","10","This is the only second TV series that I've watched since Breaking Bad (the first being Falling Skies, which I liked for the first couple of seasons but then went downhill enough in the 3rd and 4th seasons so that I finally gave up on it). This series so far has done better.
The Vikings have always been more complex than they were portrayed in movies. They traded as much as they raided, and on trading missions reached as far as the southern Mediterranean. This series seems to accurately reflect the history (I'm no expert but have read just a few books, and have visited Iceland and the other Scandinavian countries), portraying the Vikings as intelligent and capable innovators in shipbuilding, navigation, and they were ahead of their time in the the higher status of women compared to most Medieval societies, besides their formidable fighting skills.
The first season sets the stage and develops the main themes and characters who will dominate the rest of the series. The script is intelligent, the acting good, and the cinematography spectacular as it was filmed in Ireland. The first season is off to a strong start and I'll be eager to see if the second season is as strong as the first.",
"4","10","Season 1 had a lot of groundwork for the series to lay out,
and the characters you end up liking don't always do likeable things,
but the story, drama and character acting is well worth the time investment as they set the table for the show in season one.
I watched it a second time through when a family member got started watching it,
and there's so much put into play in this season, watching it a second time was helpful.
The History part is not always spot on (known History is spotty in parts, but obvious changes have been made compared to what we think we know about the times),
but it's a great telling of the story, even if not 100% accurate.
Research the real history,
but beware you could spoil some of the show for yourself.",

"6","10","I've seen all kinds of animes, mostly adult ones because usually they have a better story then kid shows, and I had nothing left to watch so i googled 2013 animes and this one seemed slightly interesting, watched a trailer first and didn't like the trailer, watched the 1st episode and I was hooked, watched the 2nd and i was totally hooked, watched the 3rd and it blew my mind, now I will have to wait every week for an episode daaamn, the first 3 episodes of this anime prove that this anime will be an awesome one, you can foretell that by watching how the first episodes is building up this hype-level of an awesome story which started out sad and is going to become epic and bloody. The concept is unique and I like it. Humans who live inside 50 meters high walls to protect themselves from titans (giants), Eren the main character feels unpleasant about it compared to everybody else because that's not really true freedom for a human to be "livestock" inside walls, waiting to get eaten by titans. One day, and that would be the day they would all remember for eternity, the day when first wall fell and hell broke loose, this is where the story starts. And it just gets better and better! There's a lot of emotional and bloody scenes which usually makes up for a good story. You know those animes that catch your eyes on the first episode, this is one of them.",
"7","10","This anime just keeps me on the edge of my seat. Each week I watch and each week I want more. It's intense. The concept and story line are on point and keep you thrilled and wanting more. The only downside is the seven-day waiting for the next episode. Definitely one of the best anime I have seen. 
I often watch anime for fun and as a means of passing the time away but with this it's different. I can't tear my eyes away for even a second. A masterpiece in the making. I just hope the producers keep this running for longer instead of cutting it short into a 20-something episode thing such as SAO or BTOOOM!.
Do yourself a favor and follow it.",
"8","10","I am not much of an Anime buff, sure I watched my fair share when I was a teenager but most Animes simply do not grab as much as I would like. There is of course Akira and Ninja scroll and stuff like that people in general should watch at least once in their life. The only Anime TV show that I watched from the beginning was Fist of the North Star. A real classic in my opinion.
Seems like I found another show that I consider already a classic in the making. I am proud to say after watching 3 Episodes of |Attack on Titan| I am blown away. The show is nicely paced, the whole plot is so simple, yet strong and the whole concept of having the human race, that consist of mostly German people or so it seems, locked up behind walls is really, really compelling.
The art is superb and a joy to watch. From the Bavarian town over to the great painted landscapes, character design etc. It is all top notch in my opinion.
Stuff like the charging Armored Titan is even for an old timer like just to cool to pass up. What a great scene that was. I cannot wait for the next episode.",
"9","10","This anime is simply amazing! The way it is animated, the soundtrack, the characters, the story, the thrill and the suspense. All in one action-packed anime. One of the best so far. As it has only 9 episodes as of now ... many critics say that it is way too early to rate an anime. But, according to me, this is pure class. The soundtrack's tempo varies according to the situation and this makes it more exciting. The ending of the episode is something that NO one will look forward to as NO one will want it to end. A must watch for every anime lover and of course the manga is available as well. Although a bit gory, the epicness makes up for it! You know those animes that catch your eye from the first episode, this is one of them.",
"10","10","A well made anime. The feel this show gives is just awesome. I always want more of it and one episode a week is just so not fair. Right now I am on 20th episode and it's really getting better.
The show hooked me from the very first episode. How action and emotions connects and make a perfect atmosphere for Titans, monsters who like to eat humans just for fun, and humans, fighting for their existence when stuck inside three walls.How main characters who aren't super powerful yet give a promising touch to the show. And how they show a real management work even when their is anger, fear and blood in the air.
Characters are super cool and feel real unlike regular animes. This show is a guarantee of entertainment. Give it a try.",
"11","10","Only 6 episodes in while writing this review, but wow what a start. Firstly the music and voice acting are seriously good, and the art/animation is top notch, very nice indeed. Then regarding the story line - right from the off we get deep into the scenario, the characters, and their fear. The anime does an amazing job of portraying the characters emotions, you really get the sense of how much of a helpless position the humans are in. Quite a lot has happened already in these first 6 episodes, with already some shocks and unexpected events. Really has been an incredible start to this anime, and that is what I have rated it on, though I have extremely high confidence this one will be one that gets better and better.",
"12","10","I have to give this anime a 10 our of 10! Ever since the first 2 episodes, which was in my opinion one of the best hook-on I have seen, it was very intense and conveyed fear to the viewers very well. Some people complain that it has gotten slow or was boring in some episodes, but I don't think they fully grasp how important each episode is. First I think ever since the first 2 episodes, it made people raise their standards and expected more and more action every time. The show does an amazing job on building character and storytelling in general. I doesn't have to have action all the time just for it to be good. This anime is top-notch! The money and time they invested in this Manga adaption was well done! Excellent! Animation is beautiful! Whatever the effect they use for the Tian's animation is also nice. My next obsession is the soundtracks! I am so glad Hiroyuki Sawano helped worked on it. He is a highly valued music composer that is remarkable at making one of the most epic soundtracks, such as Gundam UC: Unicorn. The Manga's content was a lot more gory, but they adapted it and censored it in a way that did not ruin the story. Voice over is also excellent! Expresses feelings and other emotions strongly and effectively.",
"13","10","I have seen a lot of animes and all kinds of shows and I must say, that the first 6-8 episodes of Attack on Titan, are in my opinion, the pinnacle of anime series so far. The plot, the characters, the animation, the soundtrack...are all top notch. Special mention for the first opening: epic is the word for it. Try and watch the first 5 episodes and you won't be disappointed.",
"14","10","To all the miserable people who have done everything from complain about the dialogue, the budget, the this and the that....who wants to hear it? IF you missed the point of this beyond-beautiful movie, that's your loss. The rest of us who deeply love this movie do not care what you think. I am a thirthysomething guy who has seen thousands of movies in my life, and this one stands in its own entity, in my book. It was not supposed to be a documentary, or a completely factual account of what happened that night. It is the most amazing love story ever attempted. I know that it is the cynical 90's and the millennium has everyone in a tizzy, but come on. Someone on this comments board complained that it made too much money! How lame is that? It made bundles of money in every civilized country on the planet, and is the top grossing film in the planet. I will gladly side with the majority this time around. Okay, cynics, time to crawl back under your rock, I am done.",
"15","9","I avoided watching this film for the longest time. Long before it was even released I had dismissed it as an over-hyped, over-blown, overly romanticized piece of Hollywood schmaltz, and I wanted nothing to do with it. I never watched it in the theatre. I shook my head in disbelief at the 11 Academy Awards - even though I had never seen it. Then I was asked to be a judge at a high school public speaking contest. One of the girls spoke about this movie. "It was so great," she said. "You really felt like you were on the ship." "Nonsense," I thought. I shared my feelings with my fellow judges. One looked at me and said, "you might be right, but if she liked the movie that much maybe she'll want to learn more about the real Titanic. The movie must have done something right to get her so interested." "Well, maybe," thought I. Then it finally appeared on Pay TV. "OK," I thought, "I'll give it a look see." I didn't want to like it - and I didn't. I loved it! What a great movie.
Where to start? First - the directing. My high school public speaking contestant was right. James Cameron does a superb job of creating an almost "you are there" type of atmosphere. The gaiety of life aboard the most elegant ship in the world. The nonchalance as news of the iceberg first spreads; then the rising sense of panic. You don't just watch it; you really do feel it. Then - the performances. The lead performances from Kate Winslet (as Rose) and Leonardo DiCaprio (as Jack) are excellent - Winslet's being the superior, I thought, but both were good. They had their rich girl/poor boy characters down to a perfect "t" I thought. In my opinion, though, stealing the show was Frances Fisher as Rose's mother. She was perfect as the snobby aristocrat, and you could feel the fear and loathing she felt every time she looked at Jack. Then - the details. I'm no expert on the sinking of the Titanic, but I have a reasonable general knowledge, and this film does a super job of recreating the historical details accurately and then weaving them seamlessly around the fictional romance. Very impressive, indeed. Then - the song. Who can watch this movie and not be taken with Celine Dion's performance of "My Heart Goes On."
Problems. Well, the romance was perhaps too contrived, in the sense that I just don't accept that Jack could have moved so effortlessly from steerage to first class. (I know he was invited the first time; but he seems to keep getting into first class without being stopped until he's been there for a while.) The realities of the separation of the social classes were much more realistically portrayed, I thought, when the steerage passengers were going to be left locked down there after the ship hit the iceberg while the first class folks got to enjoy half empty lifeboats. 
A minor quibble, though. This is truly an excellent movie. My only regret is not seeing it in the theatre, where I think it would have been so much more impressive.",
"16","10","This movie re-wrote film history in every way. No one cares what anyone thinks about this movie, because it transcends criticism. Every flaw in the movie is easily overcome by the many amazing things the movie has going for it. It is an extremely beautiful movie, and I doubt many of us will see anything like it again. I've seen it more times than I care to count, and I still become transfixed every time, with a feeling which is hard to describe. One for the ages.",
"17","10","It really physically hurts me when i don't see it in top 250 in IMDb's list.I am from India where the general perception of Hollywood movies are that they are more action oriented big budget entertaining films.We consider our films to be more emotional and poignant.
However this movie is the most heart touching story i have ever seen on screen.I could see people's faces with tears rolling down after departing from the cinema hall.I could hear my father saying " Never knew that these people could make such heart warming movies".Maybe i am going a bit too far.But this is my way of paying tribute to the greatest movie ever made.",
"18","7","
Отряд самоубийц. Максимально распиаренный продукт с претензией на самый лучший фильм этого лета. Вообще надо отметить, что сейчас случился настоящий бум фильмов по комиксам. Каждый 3 фильм в кинотеатре имеет отношение к ним. Отряд самоубийц мне понравился, все было в рамках ожиданий. Шикарный актерский состав состоящий из знатоков своего дела. Говоря о знатоках я имею в виду Уилла Смита и Марго Робби. Они вдвоем тащат весь фильм и именно их персонажи максимально раскрыты. Еще порадовала эпизодическая Бена Аффлека (Бэтмен). Самый сок фильма это его первая часть в котором нам рассказывают про каждого персонажа в отряде. Конечно есть несколько бесполезных *игроков команды*. Самый бестолковый это капитан бумеранг и слипкнот. Их наличие или отсутствие никак не влияет на сюжет и на исход главного сражения. Еще надо отметить шикарную подборку музыки в фильме, которая задает уникальную атмосферу. Графика и спецэффекты на уровне. В центре фильма находятся сами персонажи их их раскрытие, а враги и обстоятельства находятся как бы на втором месте. Очень понравился Джокер в исполнении несравненного Джареда Лето. Хотя эпизодов с ним было мало но это были самые интересные части фильма. Так же звездой фильма была Чародейка в исполнении Кары Делевинь, она тащила на себе нелегкое бремя антагониста. В общем и целом смотреть сей шедевр явно стоит в кинотеатре.",
"19","7","Не могу сказать, чтобы фильмов о супергероях или суперзлодеях в последнее время было мало, да и огромным фанатом фильмов этого жанра я не являюсь, однако пройти мимо очередного воплощения Джокера, да ещё и в исполнении любимого мною Джареда Лето я просто не могла… Для меня, конечно, никто иной как Джек Николсон классический Джокер «не по должности, а по сути», не просто играет, а им является. Составить своё впечатление было необходимо. В итоге красочная, динамичная история о спасении мира плохими парнями (не без психологической подоплеки, конечно) и отличный актёрский состав (как, например, появление харизматичного Уилла Смита, уже сыгравшего однажды плохого-хорошего парня со сверхспособностями — Хенкока), хорошая музыка, ну и конечно Джаред Лето, самый стильно-романтичный Джокер из всех. Хорошее настроение после просмотра этого фильма обеспечено.",
"20","10","Чисто моё мнение:
Отряд самоубийц — шикарный фильм, все ожидания оправдались!
Не слушайте критиков и людей, кто постоянно идёт против общественного мнения, если вам хоть немного интересна подобная тематика — идите и не задумывайтесь даже. Марго Робби, Уилл Смит и Джаред Лето — просто идеально вписались в свои роли. Фильм был 16+ в моём кинотеатре — ничего такого там не увидел, кроме нескольких сцен с явным намёком на попку Харли. Один из лучших фильмов про суперспособности, смотрится легко и интересно.
P.S. также есть сцена после первых титров (после долгих нет, так что не сидите до конца). Всем приятного просмотра!",
"21","8","I won't lie, the movie isn't perfect. A few jokes fall flat, and make those moments awkward, but the rest is superb. The acting was more than I expected out of this movie. In terms of acting, I'll go in order of my top 3: Robbie, Leto, and Smith. All of their portrayals are excellent. El Diablo is a nice surprise, his character made us feel for him, maybe even more-so than the top stars. Leto knocks it out of the park. As a Ledger fanboy, I was dreading his performance, but his character was amazing down to the slightest movement. No amount of dialogue is wasted nor any simple movement is wasted. 
Overall, the movie was great, again, some awkward script, but the action scenes are done extremely well and the acting is great. 8/10. Leagues above Batman v Superman in my opinion.",
"22","8","Y'know I didn't hate this like everyone in the world seems to. The characters were colorful, big. I guess it's a tough task to get them all equal screen time. My suggestion would have been to cut back on the members. Problem solved.
It doesn't quite have the fun of the trailer, which can happen when someone not involved with film cuts something that may not represent the film.
Harley Quinn obviously a stand out, but the BIG ONE for me, was seeing Batman, albeit briefly. Just enough to tantalize. Wetted my appetite for his solo film which can't come soon enough.",
"23","8","Suicide Squad, although first shown as a gritty movie like its predecessors, turned out to be a genuinely fun and exciting movie filled with thrills and occasional spills. The cast had pretty good chemistry, characters interacted with one another very fluidly and pretty much everything made sense and fit together. Although the story was a bit predictable and at times stale, it made up with amazing fighting choreography and mind-blowing special effects. And the joker was legitimately one of the best jokers I have ever seen, even better than jack Nicholson's's portrayal.
Overall recommend this movie to fans and casuals alike.",
"24","8","I was pleasantly surprised with the movie overall despite poor reviews. Nice short backstory on characters that mattered and well acted for the most part. Critics try to over analyze action sci-fi flicks instead of just enjoying a well done film and letting the people judge themselves. You are not watching Gone with the Wind or The Shawshank Redemption. It's a movie based on comic book characters made for adolescent adults to enjoy! Just be happy someone put this together and only hope for a sequel! If I never saw the story between Harley and The Joker continue it would be a real shame! Also the Will Smith performance was not as bad as reported! This isn't a role for Tom Hanks or he would have been cast!",
"25","9","I think a lot of people expected this movie to be a lot different than what it actually was and expected a lot more "Action" or to see the "superheroes" as the villains. As a true DC Comic Fan Girl I have to say that the movie followed the comic, the characters were portrayed as they were in the comic and considering that mesh of the actors this movie is a great watch. I didn't get sucked into the movie, but that doesn't mean it wasn't a good movie. The effects were a bit cheesy in a couple parts but the overall acting quality was good, the story line was a "love story" at the heart and I do feel that the ending was not what the viewers wanted by any means, since the woman isn't killed but as I stated before it does follow the ending of the comic. Personally, if you're a DC Comic fan then no matter what this movie is a great watch, if you're looking for Action and the "superhero" feel then you need to watch Captain America or if you're looking for more of a comedic movie then check out Deadpool but compared to those two Suicide Squad is a 6/10 but compared to the comic and viewing experience its a 9/10.",
"26","8","It's about 8.5 worth of a movie in my book, for some real good acting and well written roles. That is, some well written roles, had it been true with all the characters in this movie, this would've been a real masterpiece, but all too often it did fall short of the quality performance of Will Smith, Margot Robbie and Joel Kinnaman. there are a few other solid performances which didn't get their characters developed enough to shine like these three, especially Viola Davis who's very good as the perfect government agent that sees nothing but getting their job done, but truth is her role is too one dimensional, and there was room for real depth here. Same is true with Jai Courtney and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje. Jared Leto, isn't bad in his role, but it's hardly a role to speak about, and he was hyped from here to forever, so it was a letdown. But the roles that were properly written were really superb and the three actors I mentioned did them great justice. This together with a reasonable plot and solid technical aspects of this production, make it a worth your while movie. But once again this could've been a lot better, and the fact it's not is plain shame.",
"27","9","This is a good, fun movie. If you like comic book movies you will enjoy "Suicide Squad". I'm not sure why many critics think that this great movie was so "terrible". It had great acting from the entire cast, especially Margot Robbie and Will Smith and it had just the right amount of jokes. That being said this movie wasn't perfect either, but no movie is. The story could have been better, but it was still good and worked fine for Suicide Squad. Also, it should have been longer. When you have so many character that haven't been on the big screen before this you need to use as much time as possible to develop their back stories, which wasn't done very well. For the characters with the largest roles like Deadshot or Harley Quinn their are fairly short backstories, while the backstories for characters like Killer Croc are given no screen time. This doesn't take away from the overall film too much, but it is the reason that I couldn't give it a 10/10.",
"28","8","The movie is definitely Fun to watch! I, along with my friends enjoyed the Humour inserted all though some of the dialogues showed that they tried pushing the humour... I loved Joker, Harley Quinn, Headshot as well as El Diablo! I enjoyed the animated Killer Croc. All though I have had mixed feeling about Enchantress i still was disappointed about the enchantress's Brother being animated. Also pushing deadshot as thinking about his Daughter was definitely not working for me or any of my friends... I am happy about seeing Batman. The movie was of great pace.... the action sequence was fun! I enjoyed so many things. David Ayer definitely made the Dark DC theme very appealing!! The dancing fire in El diablo was so cool!! i definitely Love the movie so did my friends! Its not a super awesome movie, but definitely a treat for the eyes!",
"29","8","Every now and then there is a movie with a great cast line up and fun creative out of the box idea. This is that movie. The choreography of this film is great, while they spent their budget well on special VFX the acting is not all that cliché, it's different. The film doesn't waste one second of enjoyable footage with stunning action an amazing soundtrack it shows how dc is really not failing to disappoint it's fans. This movie is good even for people who don't follow comics or watch the other films this movie still amazes random viewers. It's creative aspect follows throughout with good crummy jokes and a threatened appearance. everyone has a good role in the film. Jared Leto kicks it well as the joker showing off his impressive laugh and dark skill set. Margot Robbie plays the mysterious, crazy Harley Quinn who will make anyone want to fall to their knees begging for more. 
No matter what this is not a film to miss.",
"30","8","Suicide Squad is a great action packed fun popcorn movie. The critics out there that are expecting a cinematic masterpiece from a come book film should not be critics. As David Ayer (Director) has stated he made this film for the fans and I believe if you are a fan of comic book films and a DC fan you will really enjoy this film. Margot Robbie stole the spotlight in the film with other great actors like Will smith and Jai Courtney were also very good. Jarrod Leto's Joker was different but still very good. The story is plain and simple which is what the film needed with such a large cast and the villain was a great choice. If you enjoy a good action film with interesting characters you will enjoy this film.",
"31","9","Affleck as Bruce Wayne/Batman was pure awesome and dark. You can see he's traumatized by the events in the past, and he has some fantastic lines in general (Yes we see the whole parents thing again). Nobody should really be surprised that he was good with the role considering he's a solid actor, but I thought he was great. Versus Bale? That's a interesting question, because Affleck definitely regards Batman as a permanent part of his persona, while in Nolan series he eventually doesn't want Batman. In combat he's pretty much everything everyone would hope for from a film with Batman. One comment on the latest BvS trailer said he fought like the Arkham video games from a scene they showed. That's a good comparison. He's incredible in fights. Also the way Snyder records him in action, you can actually see him fighting unlike the Nolan films, which I'd imagine would make many people happy. He also gets a chance to use his detective skills, do not worry. Also his relationship with Irons, who plays Alfred, is just wonderful in general. Irons was exceptional in the role (Its Jeremy Irons for Christ's sake, of course he nailed the role) gets some witty lines and also gets pretty emotional later on. He didn't get a lot of screen time, just enough to be effective. Always passing advice to Batman.",
"32","10","Boy oh Boy....this was a great experience....I have to say after Man of Steel (which was okay but by no means great), I didn't have much expectations from this, and to top it off the castings for this film had set the comic book fans on fire. But tell you what, this is epic. Some people are even calling it better than the Dark Knight, while I wouldn't go that far, I would still call this a complete package. Affleck's Batman is AMAZING. His Bruce Wayne is not as cool and casual as Christian Bale's but he doesn't need to considering this is a relatively old Batman who has seen some very dark times. His partnership with Jeremy Irons adds some much needed lightness to the movie. Cavill delivered the dialogues during the fight scene with Batman in a near perfect way. Gal Gadot had a much bigger role to play than seen in the trailers. And Jesse was good in a complex way. Fans have to understand that his Luthor is not muscular as compared to what we have seen in previous Superman movies His Luthor is an evil genius who does a great job of pitting the two giants against each other. Jesse played the role to his strengths as he should have. Contrary to the popular perception(especially after the third trailer) that the whole movie was spoil-ed, the plot was way more deeper than we imagined. The only issues were a fight scene where CGI looked dull and maybe, just maybe a bit over stuffing. But overall, this is EPIC.",
"33","10","I think that the movie was really good it mixed it in with there origin stories and then had the fighting scene at the end I think it was a good movie. There was a little bit to much talking but it gave information about the characters. All in all the movie was good and the characters were excellent and that it is the only movie with batman, superman and wonder woman in it at the same time. look at the bright side this movie leads up to the first ever justice league movie with all different characters it will be the best DC movie ever. well that is what I think some people will disagree and others wont. But i think it was a really good movie and I loved wonder woman.",
"34","9","As a whole, I really enjoyed the movie. I thought Ben Affleck, to my surprise, did a fantastic job as an older Batman. Henry Cavill, as the last time, did a fantastic job as Superman. I can't wait to see what's next in this story line from these two.
There were only a few parts that had me scratching my head, such as I wasn't really a fan of Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. I thought he acted more like the Joker in this movie. That did not affect my overall feel for this movie though.

"35","9","We have many expectedness about these movie, specially because we read about these stories at comics and the transition from the comic to the movie is not a easy work. I enjoyed the movie because I like both main characters. Also it was the opportunities to have a very good family time. I think that it is a very good effort from DC to have his own space at screens versus Marvel, many of the comics' characters need this opportunity for be known by the public. I want to see the next DC's movies to come. I don't like some specific details, but in general terms It is a good movie. The best criticize is going to be yours when you have watched the movie.",
"36","8","I can see why this movie is getting a lot of negative criticism, first oh my God Ben Affleck as Batman this is one of the main ones that I want to talk about. Ben did a FANTASTIC job as Batman and I can't wait to see him again as the dark knight. Secondly everyone is bitching about the tone of the film, yes it's dark with very little humour or even light scenes but that's the point Batman is a dark and troubled character, but he isn't the only DC character who has a dark concept. Third this is kinda like the Justice League prologue because it has cameos from The Flash,Auqaman and Cyborg and around the end of the movie Bruce and Diana were talking about contacting the other meta humans and that part gave me chills.",
"37","9","I'm definitely a Superhero fan with Batman & Superman easily being at the top of the list. When the trailers began coming out, they got me excited as expected. Perhaps the trailers became excessive & contributed to a higher potential for harsh reviews. I agree that it could have been better. I also can see how some would not like the movie. However, if you are a fan of this sort of movie like I am, it seems to me people have simply piled on the negativity. One dream sequence did throw me off a bit. The flow was fine with me. I was even expecting to be somewhat disappointed. The music could've been better, as was in Man of Steel. So to keep it simple, if you were excited to go see it, do it! I'm glad did. I will watch it again as well. Not to mention, am looking forward to the continuation.",
"38","9","This was fantastic! I can safely say that Ben Affleck is my new favourite on-screen Batman (asides from Kevin Conroy, but I was talking live action.),and he was great as Bruce Wayne, too. I very much enjoyed the banter between Bruce and Alfred, who Jeremy Irons perfectly embodied. The film was a little dark, however. One of my favourite bits of this movie was the third and final act. Doomsday was a tad unnecessary, but I still loved it! I'm a huge DC Comics geek, and seeing the famous trinity unite for the first time on the big screen was a complete joy! I was nerding out and smiling throughput the entire thing! And when Bruce mentions gathering the other heroes together when at (spoilers) Superman's funeral. It makes my anticipation for Justice League: part one even stronger! This, however, is not a movie for small children. I just wanted to clarify. All in all, I can't wait for the DCEU to build up more!",
"39","10","This movie is a must fo anyone's collection. It's clean, exciting and fun to watch. It gave me a whole new view on piracy. I mean every pirate in movies and plays before this either had a parrot, a peg-leg or an eye-patch. Pirates of the Caribbean doesn't have any of those stereotypes. Depp plays his role brilliantly, there is not a dull moment when he's on screen and Bloom portrayed the love-sick blacksmith perfectly as well. Knightley's role was a bit modern(strong, take-charge feminist), but that also added to the movie, she was great. I could go on about the actors, but there wouldn't be any more room, they were marvelous! This movie is mysterious, every single time I watch it, I can barely pull myself away from the screen! THis is without a doubt, the best movie I've seen yet.(A)",
"40","10","Having always been interested in pirates, curses, and adventures (when it comes to movie entertainment) this movie appealed to me the first time I saw a preview for it. I've watched this movie at least a dozen times and I still can't get over how amazingly well Johnny Depp fits the part of Captain Sparrow. His gestures, facial expressions, and his script make this movie not far from a masterpiece. Honestly it took me 2 or 3 times to completely understand the plot and all the dimensions of the curse. However, watching all the extra scenes and info on the DVD made me realize how much fun the director had making the movie (when was the last time you saw a pirate movie that cool??) Again, I greatly applaud Johnny Depp's performance and I can't wait to see Pirates of the Caribbean 2!",
"41","10","I did not originally see the movie in the theater but rented it when it came out on video and loved it. I have eventually bought it and have watched it so many times I have lost count. I thought Johnny Depp's performance was really good and you couldn't help but love him. I also liked that the movie didn't have a lot of gore and sex in it but still kept the viewer captivated. As for T. Robertson's comment on Captain Sparrow having been under the curse too the whole time-he was not. Jack only came under the curse after having slipped a coin out of the chest after Will had been captured (You have to watch closely). That in itself was rather clever on Sparrow's part since you can't do battle with an immortal pirate and win if you are mortal. :-)This one definitely ranks in my top ten favorite movies. I hope they make another one.",
"42","10","OK, so everything that I could say has all been said in the other reviews already, but I can't stress just how enjoyable this film is. It's a wild ride that keeps you laughing and thrilled from beginning to end. Johnny Depp is incredibly funny and incredibly sexy, and since potc I have become a JD addict, which is costing me a fortune on Ebay. The special effects are perfect - the pirates are very funny and not overdone at all. It is fun for all the family, and I can't think of anybody who isn't a complete kill joy, who wouldn't enjoy this film. It's always worth a watch when you need cheering up. I have seen it around 9 or 10 times and there will be more. Can't wait for the sequel, and praying that they can secure Johnny for part 3 too.",
"43","9","Pirates of the Caribbean is a well-written, well-made, and well-acted film. Do not expect a simple action film; it is humourous and creepy, fascinating and thrilling. Like most films, there are a couple of holes here and there in the fabric of the story; but this film wasn't made for the Oscars, it's meant to entertain and it succeeds in full at that. It's a jolly good time with some good actors (and great Academy Award Winner Geoffrey Rush) and high adventure on the high seas. Not to be missed!",
"44","10","This movie tops them all with AMAZING direction, AMAZING moods, AMAZING music and mostly AMAZING OF ALL AMAZINGS... acting! I have the biggest passion for Johnny Depp and thought this was the most hilarious role to have him play. He did it flawlessly! and he's so hot! Just an added bonus. Orlando Bloom was probably at his best in this movie as well, and because i don't really like him at all, that is definitely a huge compliment to say the least. And if all i told you about this movie is that it was produced by Jerry Bruckhiemer, then you would automatically know it is something worth watching. From The Amazing Race, to CSI, Jerry Bruckhiemer produces everything worth watching. And don't get me started on the flawlessly beautifully talented Keira Knightly. She is beautiful, has the cutest accent and is extremely talented! Honestly, if you didn't like this movie you have got to have something seriously wrong with you - it's a classic to be remembered for the rest of time!",
"45","10","This film is absolutely mind-blowing!I watched it the first time and was very impressed with Johnny Depps performance as Captain Jack Sparrow.He really put his effort into this film and suited the part very well.I was also impressed with Keira Knightleys performance as Elizebeth Swann she too suited the part very well.I am very glad that Pirates of the Caribbean 2 is coming out next year!!!!I think that the beginning was fantastic and introduced the characters well.The storyline as a whole was very impressive.This film is fun of laughter,romance,action and a lot of drama!This is a film you have got to watch!!!",
"46","10","I thought that this movie was the best!!! I thought it was the best movie because it has Johnny Depp in it!!! :p Boy is he hot!!:D:D:D:P:P:P I think that anyone who sees this movie has got to agree that it is one of the best movies ever!! I hope they make another move!!! I wonder if there will be as much suspense in the next two movies as in the first movie?? I hope to watch this movie again and again because it is the best movie in the world!! I just have to watch any movie with Johnny Depp in it cause he's the best actor in the world!! Why don't you go out and get it and see for yourself that is is an awesome movie!!",
"47","10","I think that this is one of the best movies that i have ever seen. I own it on DVD and watch it every time that i get the chance. I can not wait for the next one. Hopefully it is as good as the first, but i have no doubts. Johnny Depp is a great actor and he plays the part of Jack Sparrow well. Orlando Bloom is great too. I think that all the actors played a big part in making the movie and they put it all together and made it come to life. Thanks to everyone involved!! The next one sounds really good and as soon as it comes out i am going to gather up all of my friends and we are going to go see it in theater. It is going to be really fun and i hope that it comes out soon because i can't wait.",
"48","10","Magnificent! I will start off with the one problem so that I can end by thrashing it with compliments: Too long. If they had just cut out all the crap in the scenes which made this movie so long it would've gotten a perfect 10 from me (I gave it a 9). But anyway, no movie is perfect. To the compliments, Jack Sparrows (Johnny Depp) was out of this world. His performance was just outstanding. No one in my opinion could have done the role better and I could probably find a better person for the role of just about every main role in a movie except this one. The way he says things are the kind of jokes that make you laugh in your head and think about what and outstanding movie it is without laughing out loud. It's like when you go a movie with someone and you don't hear them laugh once but when they come out they say it was the funniest movie they've ever seen it's because the jokes are the kind that if you laugh out loud you're going to sound crazy. That's what all comedies look for and this one got it right with Johnny Depp.",
"49","10","A movie that was suppose to have Orlando as lead, is taken by my beloved Johnny Depp. I have been a fan of his since I can't even remember how far back. I not only drool over him, his talent is true and original. How many sexy males do you know that would or could pull off a very believable rendition of a punk-rock pirate named Jack Sparrow. The plot is almost perfectly mending to all genre's and pulls anyone in by its diverse levels of movie goers. If you like action, comedy, and anything with Johnny Depp, this is the one to see. I recommend other Johnny Depp movies, and that you keep watch on Keira Knightly, and Orlando Bloom for other upcoming movies to see that they are savvy actors and actresses.",
"50","10","I have probably seen this movie 15 times. I love movies and I am terribly critical of them. When I read the goofs page on this movie, I was shocked to see how many there were. IT is not good that the editors let so many slide. But, as a whole, this is a great mindless movie. I read a review by another user that said a good movie is one that raises important issues and questions; I agree. But, there can be other kinds of good movies. This is one! Watch it with an empty mind needing entertainment and the willingness to pass off goofs by saying "it is a movie" and you will find great satisfaction in Pirates. All in all, I would call this a new classic because it appeals to the masses who generally care nothing for "great art films".",
"51","10","Johnny Depp, in my humble opinion, has been ignored far too long by Tinseltown. His acting in this film was truly gifted and inspired. If you have not seen this movie, please do so. Mr. Depp is able to completely submerge in whatever character he plays and he does so amazingly in his portrayal of Captain Jack Sparrow. A pirate with a heart of gold! Oh, the movie is great, too! Orlando Bloom is fantastic and the special effects are quite phenomenal. I cannot believe that the Disney Studies actually produces this film so perhaps there is still hope for them after Eisner.",
"52","10","This is one of the best pirate movies you will see in a long while. That is until they make the sequel. Pirates of the Caribbean, is an action adventure film with a great cast and a wonderful story line. It starts in Port Royal, Jamaica. Where Elizabeth Swann, the governor's daughter gets kidnapped by a crew of cursed pirates. Right before the kidnapping a pirate by the name of Jack Sparrow comes into town looking to commandeer a ship. Sparrow agrees to team up with Elizabeth's childhood friend Will Turner in search of Elizabeth. But what Will does not know is that Jack is linked to the kidnapping and the cursed pirates in more ways than one. To find out the rest, see the movie! A must see for all adventure lovers and Johnny Depp fans of course! Take my word, a great movie. My rating is an A!.",
"53","10","The film was filled with extreme comedy and great action scenes. Much of Depp's acting was reminiscent of his work in Fear and Loathing, but it was hillarious and well worth the nine dollars. The action scenes were packed with entertainment, and were very frequent. All ages can enjoy this movie, and most likely will. If you have the ability to get to a theatre, go to one, and see this movie.",
"54","10","This was the best movie of the summer!!!! It had me laughing a lot and Orlando Bloom looks really good!!! Johnny Depp uniquely portrays Captain Jack Sparrow and it's so much fun for everyone!!! Don't wait another second go and see it right now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",
