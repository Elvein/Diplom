"1","5","The show is mildly entertaining; it is a guy-show with lots of war and intrigue, but the characters are all so deeply flawed that it makes the show difficult to watch at times. The feminist themes are, frankly, so unrealistic historically it is an insult to the audience's intelligence. The show would be much better with out all of the feminist non-sense. Really, guys don't want to see that feminist stuff; take that out, and the show would be much more fun to watch.",
"2","5","The video was great....only problem was we had to watch it on laptop because it set up for European DVD. Our fault, we didn't read the complete ad before we ordered.",
"3","5","I like the show and its plot but the sound really sucks. The back ground miusic is so loud that it drowns out the spoken dialogue. Other wise I would have given the show a 5. We watched it thru season 2 and am watching season 3 now. The sound hasn't improved, but the show is still good.",
"4","5","I'm sorry to say that I watched the 1st three episodes before losing interest. The photography and setting are absolutely spectacular and everything was very well acted, but the dialog and story just did not do much for me. I watched 3 episodes because I realize that it can take time for a story and the characters to develop, but I just didn't see any improvement from the first episode to the third. I really think the writers are to blame for the shortfall. If I get desperate enough for something to watch, I may come back and watch some more episodes, but for now I'm moving on to other options.",
"5","5","A little too dark and depressing for me.
It's hard to pull for the main characters when they are so terrible.
I will not be watching other seasons.",
"6","5","The writing would have to be pretty compelling to keep me interested in a story in which the main protagonist spends the whole first episode plotting to and successfully sailing to England to slaughter and loot an unsuspecting monastery full of completely unarmed, innocent, peaceful monks. This episode failed to meet that standard for me. The acting is pretty strong. The story of the development of new navigation technology was the only interesting element to me. The production values are high. The music has the ubiquitous 2000's soundtrack sound. The hairstyles are a bit silly.",
"7","5","Not terrible at all, but not terribly compelling, either. I suspect different editing would have improved this, but we don't really get behind some motivations and some teases are never answered. But it's pretty.
There are a few nice touches buried in the writing -- Ragnar gets the sunboard from "a wanderer," which an informed viewer can interpret as Odin, which is kind of fun. But that same informed viewer is not going to feel any suspense about whether the party will survive the voyage to mythical England (let's see, it said AD 793 right on the screen, so I think they're going to make it, probably early June). Athelstan's denial of Christ three times is also well done, even if we never see Athelstan deal with that significant reenactment himself.
But the writing is fairly uneven. [minor spoilers follow] Ragnar has two supernatural visions in Ep 1 and then absolutely nothing thereafter. We pass from one antagonist who kills his loyal henchmen for no good reason to another antagonist who kills his loyal henchmen for no good reason, with neither losing popular support for their unstable leadership. The potential for meaty character development -- how will the wife of a dead earl befriend the wife of a new one? -- is often passed over. And really, there's no reason for Ragnar to ask his slave to participate in a threesome (historically improbable, given contemporary views on both M/M sex and male slaves tapping their masters' wives) and then to respect his slave's declining, except for some modern titillation and a consent nod -- but not enough consent to ask that same slave whether he's okay with being ritually sacrificed....
I finished Ep 8 and realized I didn't care that much if I missed Ep 9; I just wasn't invested in the characters. It's disappointing, as I really wanted to like it better.",
"8","5","I'm probably in the minority here, but this show just doesn't do it for me. There are not really any likable characters and poor character development. The story also meanders like a soap opera with betrayals and relational drama that is so predictable that it's annoying. I know that this is a highly rated series. I'm not sure why I couldn't connect with it, but I gave it 9 episodes and I've given up. If you want a good Vikings story, go with "The Last Kingdom" on Netflix. No comparison.",
"9","5","Some care was put into the staging and filming of this series. The circumstances, building, clothes, etc are about as primitive and bedraggled as they probably would have been. However, the opening combat scene completely misses the source of military dominance that made the Norse so feared. They were NOT the better swordsmen, they were just a LOT bigger and stronger warriors. They were a foot bigger than their opponents! The miserable medieval diet produced people who were barely five foot tall. The better agricultural Norse diet, no doubt with some help from the genes, produced people 6 feet tall! The opening scene totally misses this point.",
"10","5","I was hoping for some real background on Viking culture along with some ruling class intrigue and boats. What we are give are Clichèd characters, relationships that aren't fleshed out enough to make sense let alone be interesting enough to continue watching. Oh Well.,",
"11","5","so far Season 1 has been pretty good. I am enjoying the season and I would recommend this series. They seem to put a lot of effort into making it very interesting. This was not a era for women. I like the fact that the actors are Scandinavian & act their parts very well. The stories appear to be well written.",
"12","5","Entertaining show with good characters and better than average acting. Don't know enough facts about the Vikings to comment on clothing, social structure or living conditions but a lot of thought and expense went into the presentation of this show. Plots are pretty standard about the bad, controlling and self serving ruler who must be taken down by a common man. Some minor technical flaws but they don't diminish the quality of the show.",
"13","5","Great start, loved the setting, art and surprising brutality.
However, it lacks character development, while their suffering in the first episodes gave them good soil to grow, they all just kept moping around with their ineptitude, not learning anything.
Also the main plot barely moves at all. Im not expecting to know everything by the end of a season, but I would like to see at least some aspect of the titans origins explained.
After a while all the brutal deaths and gore grows boring, it seems all minor characters are there just to be fodder for making "shocking" moments. The series might still be rescued by following seasons, but as it stands now, I wouldn't recommend this.",
"14","4","I'm not even sure how to start this review, I'm just stunned at the amount of people giving this show 9 and 10/10.
It's a really bad show.
The animation is great, no argument there, and the basic concept is genius, the titans look fantastic and are truly terrifying.
But then we get to the story and the character and the pacing and the show just all falls apart. The main character Eren is just a moody teenager who only ever talks through gritted teeth in an over-dramatic tone. his best-friend Armin is just a terrible character, he's the cliché nerd but his character design is just awful, he looks like a girl and I can't find anything likable about him, he just whines and whines. which bring us to ALL THE OTHER CHARACTERS!
Almost every character in this show is a teenager, WHY? all they do is whine and complain about how useless it is to fight, and countless episodes are taken up with each character sitting down depressed, talking about how useless they are THEN reaching a conclusion where they feel they can fight again, THEN moments later they're knocked back on their arse whining again. and this happens with EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER!
The story of the show (NOT THE CONCEPT) is just terrible and predictable, every move the military makes is just fail and no-one has any clue what they're doing, probably because the entire military is made up of teenagers.
The pacing is terrible "Battle Arcs" in the story are many episodes too long and I blame this once again on the characters, since as I said, they just sit around moping for large chunks of the episodes.
I just don't understand why this show is so highly rated? I don't mean to offend, but are the people writing the reviews too young to know there are much better animes out there so they have nothing to compare it to?
Terrible terrible show, great concept, really disappointed after all the hype.",
"15","-","Хороший, местами веселый, местами грустный фильм. Украшение фильма, конечно же Ширли МакЛейн. Обаятельная и неподражаемая женщина вне времени. Я бы тоже хотела, чтоб у меня была такая бабушка. Нет, я конечно люблю свою бабушку, но бабуля Мирабо — шикарная. Вообще я не думала писать отзыв, но Ширли МакЛейн меня вдохновила на пару строчек. 
Фильм рассказывает не только о Каролине, но и ее о семье, в каком-то смысле, мягко говоря, необычной, о людях, которые ее окружают. Ну и конечно о ее отношениях с мужчинами, которые заканчиваются после первого свидания. О друге, который любит ее, а она этого не замечает.
Фильм стоит смотреть тем, кто уважает творчество такой актрисы, как Ширли МакЛейн и кому интересна романтическая история о семейных ценностях. С удовольствием посмотрю еще раз через какое-то время."
"16","-","Привет. Вот, сходил, наконец, сегодня на «Отряд самоубийц». Что можно сказать после увиденного… даже не знаю, что. Знаю только, что немного. Потому что, в общем, не о чем говорить-то. Яркий Джокер, прям-таки идущий в ногу со временем, яркая гламурно-сумасшедшая Харли Квин, которую вряд ли вообще кто-то до фильма знал, а что, почему бы и нет? Повсюду пестрят их и без того пестрые лица. Ну а что дальше? Что за ними? 
«Ты снаружи прекрасна, а внутри уродлива «©. Ну, может можно выразиться и не так категорично. Просто пуста. Пустая оболочка с пустым содержимым. Набор бессвязных роликов, местами скучных, местами неуместно пафосных, в стиле попсового видеоклипа, связанных между собой невнятной историей людей, понты которых могут впечатлить лишь ученика начальной школы, скоропостижно притянутых за уши ради борьбы с надуманным вселенским чем-то-там и спасающим в итоге, как обычно, всех и вся (прошу прощения за спойлер). Не ново, очень не ново, не побоюсь этого слова, даже старо! Жуть, как старо! И, как уже повелось, все по классике: вот он Джокер, что-то бессвязно мямлящий себе под нос; вот она Харли Квин, изо всех сил надрывающаяся в попытках выглядеть неформальной и сумасшедшей; вот он Дедшот, усердно «решетящий» кого-то Фиг-Пойми-Кого; а еще крокодил-мэн, гопник с бумерангом, Кощей-пироман, на истории которых откровенно пофигу, даже создателям, и вот он я, сидящий в зале и думающий: «Ну вот, опять повелся!» Это ни хорошо, ни плохо. Просто никак. Серая бескрайняя масса подобных друг другу картин, огромным комом летящая в пустоту.
Общее впечатление: бюджет потрачен создателями по большей части на стилистов, гримеров, пиарщиков да рекламщиков, как обычно умело слепивших из ничего что-то, а дальше — как получится. Вполне сносный способ развода в 21-ом веке.",
"17","-","Для большинства это был ожидаемый фильм, но лично я не следил за ним, так как чувствовал, что от слишком большого пиара ничего толкового получится не может. Это уже второй DC-фильм за год и судьба у него во многом схожа с «Бэтменом против Супермена». Ожиданий было много, но не все ожидания оправдались.
Собрать злодеев в команду и сделать из нее эдаких антимстителей довольно интересна, но почему-то вышло так, что большинство этих персонажей были нераскрыты и нужны были в качестве «мебели». В центре внимания находились только два человека: Дэдшот и Харли Квинн. И получились они самые удачные. Уилл Смит в свойственной ему ироничной манере сыграл Дэдшота очень хорошо, у которого была и мотивация и своя история. Так же как и Марго Робби, которой удалось великолепно показать своего персонажа. Харли получилась именно такой, как и должна быть: забавной, опасной и в тоже время трогательной. А вот Крог, Бумеранг и Дьябло были словно лишними. Да, иногда им уделяли время, но как я уже отметил, были там словно не пришей кобыле хвост. Что касается Джокера, то тут мнений всегда будет много. Для каждого человека есть свой неповторимый образ этого эксцентричного злодея. Для одних это Леджер, для других Николсон. Но в этом фильме Джаред Лето по своему изобразил своего героя. Но лично мне казалось, что я вижу не Джокера, а простого бандита, хоть и безумного. Лето старался, а он талантливый актер; даже местами переигрывая, но слишком мало ему было уделено внимания в фильме, чтоб как-то полностью составить мнение о нем.
Все остальное в фильме получилось весьма средним. Временами были провисания в сюжете, где-то перемудрили в монтаже. Начало вообще было снято так, словно смотришь клип: куски того, куски сего. И только ближе к концу вся эта масса набирала темп. Так же хочется отметить просто великолепную подборку музыки. Но только дело в том, что это была именно подборка, которую приятно слушать отдельно. В фильме же она была вставлена невпопад. Ну это все мелкие претензии.
По сути это такой типичный летний блокбастер, от которого не стоило ждать чего-то большего. Все можно было сделать намного лучше, но вышло то, что вышло. И обидно, что снова очередной фильм DC уступает Marvel. А ведь именно DCшные злодеи на мой субъективный взгляд отличаются проработкой характеров. Но «Отряд самоубийц» к сожалению не смог полностью передать все это в своём фильме.",
"18","3","Честно говоря — не очень люблю фильмы по комиксам. Но недавний, на мой взгляд неплохой, «Бэтмэн против Супермена» и недавно же наконец просмотренные «Стражи галактики» плюс ломовой пиар «отряда» сделали свое дело — решил посмотреть.
Весь фильм не покидало ощущение, что смотрю игру нашей сборной по футболу — весь «Отряд» за исключением разве что Дэдшота (Видно, Смит старался — и может даже дай ему отдельный фильм это и был бы успех) усиленно изображал деревья. Хорошо, если пару эпизодов вывезли. Харли кривлялась — но не вытягивала совершенно — и проблема не в актерской игре, а в бездарнейшем сценарии.
И отдельный минус за Джокера. Его образ — а это пожалуй мой любимый злодей комиксов — раскрыт хуже некуда. Он уже не мрачный псих (Леджер) и тем более не зажигательный псих (Никлсон), а лишь пародия на что-то непонятное.
Вердикт — не посмотрите — не потеряете ничего. Я после просмотра перестал считать, что недавно вышедшие «Охотники за привидениями» это провал. К сожалению сборы указывают, что будет очередное унылое продолжение. Хоть сценариста бы сменили.",
"19","6","I was curious about this film, as a DC fan. The film belongs to the DC world and is a continuation of the last movie - Batman V Superman. That's why I did have the feeling to watch a series, not a movie. Too many characters tucked in barely two hours of film, however, can not be given to everyone as individuals. Most space (or time) are expected to get Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn and Will Smith as Deadshot, others are gathered crumbs and are presented in retrospectives. Joker I can not like, definitely the worst Joker in history. Too much they tried to squeeze in a film so that a slurry is full of ingredients, but the mixture was not good. The film is incomplete, with a bad story, at times too much CGI effects. If you disallow the brain, maybe you like it or you at least have a little fun. The disappointment for me.",
"20","6","A soppy movie, full of sentimental suffering, mourning and all that popular now emo-stuff. In some episodes it does work, anyhow (Rick Flagg's relation with the Enchantress has poor chemistry, but the tear- jerking does save the day). In some episodes it just annoys (there is a little hope for some better Harley-Joker sequences in the extended cut, but I'm speaking now only of the theatrical version).
The film has many action scenes, not to say great, but definitely proper ones. And there are some interesting personae, Cap'n Boomerang for instance (though he is a petty copy of Dedpool, some unpleasant charisma about him can be felt). And there are idiotic scenes with the Joker. If you came to see how Harley Quinn became his true attendant, you will not see it. She just falls in love with her psycho patient, because -- Well, because it was in the script. And so ends the story of the greatest love ever between two quirks: just not shown. As if there was nothing to show.
I can't say the movie is really bad (Margo Robby does all to turn it from a foolish, sentimental story into something more interesting, even at the count of simple fan-service). This is just a movie to watch when you want rest and relax. Almost no sense, absolutely no idea, characters, as it were, are to be judged only by their outlooks. Turn off your brain, just enjoy a nicely-made show.",
"21","4","Suicide Squad is visually appealing. In that it has bright colors all moving around. This movie would really speak to kindergarten kids. This should not be confused with cinematography, because this movie did not have any of that. The writing was atrocious beyond belief. The dialogues were pointless boring gibberish. People come to see a movie to escape from the mind numbing hackneyed small talk at work. This movie just makes you sit through 2 hours of someone else's mind numbing hackneyed small talk at work. The cast had some heavy hitters, but to no avail. Character development was a joke. It really seems to be a film written and directed by a total amateur, who hasn't the first clue about what makes a movie or a character special. The only reason I'd give this movie any stars was to recognize the effort put in by the folks in special effects and make up crew that contributed to this film. They did a good job.",
"22","4","This is the greatest disappointment of the 2016. The movie lacks the edge that was expected, and advertised during months and months of trailers. comic cons etc. Characters are shallow, story is... well bad. Joker is not even comparable to Heath Leadger's. This movie could have been the next Watchmen, instead of next rubbish. Cast was OK, except Will Smith who seems to portray same character in every movie he made for the last 5-10 years. His eyes thing in every scene became old soon. Jared Leto's Joker was not bad, but his appearance was too small for any serious character development. Harley Quinn was cool, and added some quality to overall poor movie.",
"23","4","Think of a movie with the very trivial and silly plot, an annoying and chaotic editing and a film about superheroes without real superheroes and without a real villain ... you're thinking about suicide squad.
Without dwelling too much on the technical and on the whole plot (which is ridiculous), I can not understand how it is possible that the presence of meta humans the squad is after all unnecessary accounts because in the few scenes in which collide against the bad (in most of the time roaming the streets deserted remembering endlessly to be "Bad") their presence is almost useless: in fact the army of enemies would not be able to hinder even a school of children of first grade. The end then really makes you think if everything this chaos was really needed ....",
"24","4","I really expected more from this movie. I won't spoil anything about the plot. But from the trailer everything has been pretty much about Harley Quinn and the Joker.. BUT the Joker has like no screen time. And what happened to all the jokes they were putting in after seeing Deadpool being such a success.. Lame and boring jokes that made me and the people I went with cringe big time. I won't go lower as 4 as the the rest of the movie was alright. I need to fill out this review with a lot of nonsense because I can't think of anything else to put in to this review. I guess I can talk how the trailer made this movie a masterpiece to what it really is. but Jesus... I want my money back.",
"25","4","The plot was very really weak and the action scenes were boring. It was mostly fighting endless hordes of faceless creatures like a low- budget B-movie - think Equilibrium with Christian Bale or Delta Force 2 with Chuck Norris.
It also seemed rather pointless to send the suicide squad in with special forces, when the whole point of their existence is to avoid the need to risk the lives of "good guys". 
A far more interesting plot would have involved the SS being sent on a mission that purports to be for the greater good, when in fact it's for some nefarious scheme - perhaps stealing money, destabilizing a govt. or assassinating someone etc. Hell, it would have been interesting to make the movie political and send the SS squad into a war-zone like Ukraine or Yemen.
Instead we got a real snoozer here.",
"26","5","After a long wait for this movie, I've to admit that it is one of the most disappointments I've ever had in a movie. For the first 30 minutes I didn't feel that the movie had actually begun !!!!, I didn't even know if it was a long flashbacks or the real time-line of the movie is that boring, then suddenly it became a crowded chaos disaster. The characters in my opinion don't fit with the story, and about Amanda Waller she wasn't only a crazy bitch but she was also even worse than the so-called villains or the bad guys, She killed her own team !! the good people just because they weren't supposed to work on such classified data !!! so why did she even bring them ?!!! I think Deadshot and Diablo were the best in that crap.I'll not talk about Harley Quinn or The Joker because I don't want to remember their roles Finally I think the movie wasn't written well and of course not well directed.",
"27","4","I am genuinely shocked that the rating fir this is so high. The soundtrack is pretty good. The story is so bad and lacking. A few good acting performances half saved it but the dodgy plot that doesn't really follow the comics left me upset. Maybe i am just an aficionado for comic series but i think the 7 out if 10 this got is far too high.",
"28","4","It's so shame that this movie does not seem to be anything. It has one of the weakest story lines I have ever seen. The only thing that succeeded is the good performances, and the makeup and hair-styling where it also received an Acedemy Award. You can not blame David Ayer, assuming he only got 7 weeks from Warner Bros. To create the script. The script is actually "good" to be written in 7 weeks. What also immediately shows that this movie is a cash grab. I definitely don't recommend watching this movie if you are a fan or an average movie viewer because for both, this movie is not pleasant to watch.",
"29","6","Sadly, a step down from Man of Steel. First of all, I was a bit skeptical about this movie, and thought the runtime (about 2 and a half hours) was way too long (and I wasn't completely wrong though). The action scenes were better than what we saw in the trailer. Although the doomsday scenes had terrible CGI (you'll know it when you'll see it), but overall I was happy. The movie had a lot crazy-packed action (it was directed by Zack Snyder, what do ya expect?) but the plot didn't know where it was going. A lot of scenes were a treat for me to see and I got goosebumps watching them. There was more to Jesse Eisenberg than what I saw (and hated, like most people) in the trailer. I made a bet to my friend that he'll suck in the movie, guess I'll have to pay up. He really WAS good. But just like any other movie, it's not perfect and has flaws. You can see that Zack tried hard very hard to fit everything nicely into the movie, but over stuffing was bound to happen. Other than that, I think there are some fan-boys who'll be satisfied no matter how bad the movie is. Hope my review didn't give away any spoilers in any way whatsoever, and that you end up enjoying the movie as much as (or more than) I did.",
"30","-","Посмотрел фильм и спрашиваю себя:
Зачем снимали? зачем смотрел? так и не понял… Жестокость и отсутствие смысла. Фильм о бессмысленности жестокости? Что полезного извлек из фильма?
Да, фильм для определенно узкого круга лиц. Очень узкого круга, кажется на столько узкого, что его можно было б и не снимать. Но с другой стороны до конца досмотрел, значит чем-то зацепило, наверное игра Епифанцева.
Вроде как и смотреть не стоит, но и пропустить жалко.
Оценивать такое по десяти бальной шкале невозможно. Этот фильм нельзя измерять в линейной системе координат от 1 до 10
