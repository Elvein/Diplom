"1","2","Show is great, but it's the censored version on Amazon Prime.
Most episodes are 4-6min shorter because of all the censoring. Not sure why they would, but it's pretty lame to do so and not make it clearly stated. This show deserves to be seen as the creators intended it, I will get the the rest of the seasons elsewhere.",
"2","2","It never fails to amaze me what people have become comfortable being entertained by these days. Reviewers have even used words like "realistic" to describe this modern day impression of viking life. What a joke
First thing i noticed was the "modern housewife" in viking times, and the scripted all too typical modern husband wife dynamic. It's so detached and common in every hollywood movie it's just a boring train wreck to watch. This is done obviously to please women and soften men, so watching this take place in a show about vikings i find incredibly ironic.
Then of course there are the over dramatic, over emphasized facial expressions and poses of modern day hollywood actors "going viking", that are always accompanied by stupid unrealistic over the top dramatic choreographed fight scenes, of which is the first thing you see as you begin this series.
It's almost embarrassing to watch the product of totally detached entertainment people. Like the just cheesy-ass way they take how their impression of modern life and interaction is, and give it a Viking theme. All the characters i found to be just over the top cliche versions of what people in hollywood think a Viking is. Even the scene when the Viking takes the slave Priest home, and the kids go to inspect him. That scene is an example... so "gay".
But the most over the top stupid pathetic scene of all, that told me enough is enough this is totally stupid, is the scene where the husband and wife Viking ask the priest slave to join them in bed... REALLY? I mean how absolutely unnecessarily stupid. What a gratuitous pointless scene, which was nothing more than a cherry on top of all the 'jabs' taken at the God of the Bible in all the scenes beforehand. I can see where that's all going... I'm sure a few more episodes in and i would have been treated to a homosexual relationship between the Priest and the husband Viking, and all the fun "progressive" modern day drama that follows. I could also be missing out in Season 3 the "transgender" Viking episode, where the old stiff practices of tradition are broke off like chains as we witness the liberated Viking in his full feminine glory. Just give it time, if it hasn't been done already.
This show is just typical hollywood propaganda garbage disguised behind a Viking theme, and reinforced over and over with stupid "modern wife and family dynamic" scenes breaking up standard 'out of the hollywood manual' over the top "Vikings". I recommend avoiding this crap and getting a good historically accurate book instead.",
"3","2","Terrible show. I initially couldn't get thru first episode and stopped watching. I gave it a second try and watched thru the seventh episode. As it goes on, it just gets worse. Lead actor is worst of all, but there all pretty bad. Ridiculous story lines and lack of authenticity. Dumbed down for shallow audience seeking blood and guts with no substance. Game of Thrones, its not!",
"4","2","Am incredible piece of eternally arrogant American omniscience about other people's history, when their own consists of just three miserable centuries. Centuries, filled with greed (and all the treaties with American native people shamefully broken). Waste of time - there is no story there, in that epic example of well-paid stupidity, plus another spit in Christian story, in particular. Shame!",
"5","2","I really wanted to like this show and there were some good elements, but overall, it must didn't measure up and I can't recommend it. While the cinematography and costuming were very good, the dialogue and acting were very bad. The characters were very one dimensional and story lines predictable. The whole series just didn't seem to come together and the dialogue bounced from being laughable to just plain painful. I forced myself to watch the entire series, but I definitely will not be viewing the second. It's really too bad because there is a lot of potential here. I did like the opening music.",
"6","3","I hope I'm not one of these people who's watched something with high expectation only leading to disappointment. That said, I'm more than disappointed: I was so irritated watching this crap I'm probably going to have to boycott all new animes coming out. 
I just recently finished watching Monster and found that quite disappointing too. Attack on Titan seemed like a fresher, faster paced action packed alternative to the pedestrian paced Monster anime.
However, I was able to watch all 74 episodes of Monster. I couldn't tolerate the dialogue in Attack on Titan any longer than episode 11.
I should've relied on my gut instinct how clich√© this was all going to be when seeing the typical anime intro. 
The idea is very good and fascinating at first. Big giant humanoids wiping out mankind. I love the concept. However, the last three episodes just had me cursing at my laptop with "FFS will you get on with it?" or "Oh shut up with the screaming." I started off watching with subtitles but soon found dubbing. Both are painful to listen to.
Sigh.... I miss the gritty mature atmosphere from mid 80s early 90's cyberpunk era anime films and series.",
"7","1","The tragedy of the doomed ship Titanic has inspired many books and movies. The battle between nature and technology always caught man's imagination. The latest film concerning this tragedy in the Atlantic Ocean was written and directed by famous action movie filmmaker James Cameron. The story of "Titanic" involves two fictional characters (Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet) from different backgrounds (one is a hobo-artist, the other is an aristocrat) and how their love triumphs over societal barriers and the tragedy of a sinking ship that they happen to be on.
First of all, although using a historical name, this movie had little regard to history. The plot was built around two fictional lovers, French diamond, and treasure hunters. The deaths of over a thousand of people on the greatest luxury ship of its time became a mere background. Many historical facts were simply forgotten. Where was the radio operator that ignored the iceberg warnings? Why was there no mention of the ship that was only 5 miles away from the Titanic but did not come to the rescue because its captain failed to identify the distress signal? Omitting these facts is an insult to the tragedy. And what was the point of flavoring this historical disaster with fictional cheesy romance when the story is already as sad as it is.
The overall plot was rather shallow; rich equals greed and corruption, poverty equals compassion and heroism. It is very ironic to spend $200 million to make a movie about how money corrupts. There was absolutely no human side shown in anti-heroes. It seemed like Billy Zane was playing a part of the devil. Casting was also very poor. If DiCaprio was 2 inches shorter than Winslet, you could swear she was his baby-sitter. The length of the movie was unnecessarily stretched to over 3 hours. First hour and the half was wasted on establishing the relationships between the characters that were known to audience long before they went to theater and the dialogue that was used to do so made it even worse. Hearing corny pick up lines such as "I see you" and "This is my side of the ship" generated more pain than the screams of drowning people. Also, jokes were too abundant and rather lame.
"Titanic" did involve some moving scenes such as the part when the musicians were playing while the ship was sinking but they were no way near anything original. The best thing about this film were its special effects, and that is the only thing that truly deserved an award.
Although this film lacked artistical value in overall sense, the public could not resist a sentimental story starring Romeo (DiCaprio), and so the movie became a success. Now it is safe to say that the industry will be less hesitant to invest large amounts of money in a single motion picture, so it seems that "Titanic" did achieve something after all.",
"8","1","The producers and writers of Titanic obviously believed they'd bore and alienate the targeted teen and twenty-something audience to the point of losing them if the characters had the attitudes, mannerisms and style of speech that was appropriate for the time, so they had Jack (Leonardo Dicaprio) and Rose (Kate Winslett) speaking contemporary dialogue in a contemporary style, or at least contemporary for '97. A young man in 1912 would not say, "You seem more like an indoor girl." Aside from a certain hostile type of mental patient or the most outrageous and anti-social bohemian agitator, young adults in 1912 did not repeatedly tell their elders to shut up. The creators of the film are counting on what they perceive to be the teen and young adult's lack of knowledge or interest in the values and social customs of the very early 20th century. Since they want the audience to get swept away by the drama and romance of Jack and Rose they want them to relate to everything about them. I remember that this was billed as somewhat of a a fantasy re-imagining of a real event, but this type of historical revisionism, I think, in which human behavior is simply made more familiar, is an insult to any viewer with a 3-digit I.Q. One continuity problem that really gets me is how, when the ship is sinking and Jack and Rose are still inside, the water level is lower and the water becomes calmer around them every time they have a conversation. Again, the makers of the film don't want the reality of the disaster to encroach on, or distract us from, the passionate young romance they're trying to draw us into. Clearly the creators of the film think that the romance is a bigger draw for a major segment of the audience than the story of an enormous disaster that killed over 1,500 people and I'm sure they're right, but often when true and fictional stories exist in the same movie, one weakens the impact of the other, and it's certainly true in this case. I haven't seen the new 3D version but I assume the only change is the 3D effect. This is a bland, pandering, intelligence-insulting and epically overrated epic.",
"9","2","I've just had the evidence that confirmed my suspicions. A bunch of kids, 14 to 22 put on the DVD of "Titanic" on a fantastic state of the art mega screen home entertainment type deal. Only two of them had actually seen it before. But they all had seen the moment of Kate, Leo and Celine Dion so many times that most of them felt they had seen the whole movie. Shortly after the epic started, they started to get restless, some of them left asking the others -- "call us when the iceberg appears" Over an hour and a half into the movie, only the two girls who had seen the movie before, were still there. They started shouting: iceberg, iceberg. A stampede followed, they all came back to see the sinking of the Titanic. They sat open mouthed, emitting Ohs and far outs. So, just like I thought when the movie first burst into the scene. What is this? One and a half hours waiting for the bloody thing to sink but what about the rest of the of it. Dr. Zivagho, for instance, had a similar running time, but think how much takes place in that film within the same period of time. In "Titanic" Leo teaches Kate how to spit. Look at the faces and hands of the, supposedly, creme de la creme in the first class dining room of the ship. Look at the historical details, if you can find them. The storyline is so thin that they have to introduce guns and shootings in a ship that is about to sink. The real sinking here is of film standards. All the efforts are focus on special effects and opening week ends. The film went on to become the highest grossing movie of all time so, what do I know?",

"21","1","Just awful -horrible dialogue, zero premise. Stereotype Squad as far as characters concerned...in particular the Asian 'character' which was obviously a laughably cynical afterthought and the Boomerang Joe or Pete (I didn't care) - I mean, come on! Will Smith seemed embarrassed or wincing delivering his lines -hard to tell -and as for Jared Leto's OTT indulgent 'acting' -sheesh. Margot Robbie was probably only one whose character had a few good lines. Sad to see the otherwise incredible actress from Secrets and Lies reduced to the ridiculous boss character. The CGI was awful, particularly the monster at the end. Didn't make me feel anything toward the characters -no emotional resonance whatsoever.",
"22","3","Flat jokes, one-liners and terrible chemistry make up this movie. As usual, we see a group of heroes taking on a legion of mindless alien/zombie/no-named soldiers who have absolutely no chance. There are so many awkward moments in this movie. You don't have to see the movie to know how it will play out and end. The bad guy is lame and uninteresting, who apparently has the power to instantly disarm all of the heroes but doesn't use it until the very end -- when it's too late. I get that they want to show us that she is "powerful", but they just don't know what they are doing. Just terrible.
Save your time and money. There are few memorable things about this movie.",
"23","1","Sloppy scene structure doesn't make good movies. Unconventional characters alone don't make good movies. Bad directing, bad editing, bad CGI, bad acting. If a film fails on every aspect but still is by all means successful, what does that say about it's audience. Lets stop making terrible movies. One-liner, one-dimensional characters with no depth beyond the label of "bad", "evil", "crazy" fill this movie, as a surprisingly congested script attempts to give them backstory. Although comedy is very subjective, jokes in addition to the majority of the dialogue in general is very cringe-worthy. I felt embarrassed whenever anyone spoke. It all make me want to commit suicide squad.",
"24","1","Total waste of space. Further more, a real insult to the comic fans to see their well honed characters in such distorted on-screen characterisations. There has been almost no regard to the source material. The director is armature at best, clumsy and messy most of the time. The only good scene was added by Zack Snyder which stood heads and shoulders above this mediocre film. Avoid. The cast was generally good, though I thought Will Smith looked and sounded like the fresh prince on a Halloween Night special. I would rate this a FF4 type of disaster. not something I would pay to see again or even the first time if I was so forewarned.",
"25","1","a fan made comic book movie ...please don't try to insult people who read comic books. And yess i read DC and Marvel and every other comic that is out there...and trust me this movie has nothing to do with comics except te characters. It is simply as the critics say a terrible movie....i watch the movie til the moment they went in the bar to have a drink and have a thee time!!! I tought i need a drink myself and walked out of the cinema...again this movie is terrible even for comics en dc fans!!the characters were not funny at all there wasnot even one moment in the movie that i tought this is the turning point it was like watching a bad edited movie..done by a high school kids who did his final exam in film making and use the standard bad/good guy formula and dc owed him something like 175 mil dollar",

"27","1","First of all, this is my very first IMDb review, ever. I took to the Internet so that others don't get betrayed like me. Really boring, cringing and disappointing movie I have watched in quite a while. The only amazing part about the movie is its trailer, and that's it! All, the characters are kinda forced to group up against some illogical $h!t storm that was "accidentally" created. The plotting was really poor, even a 7 or 8 grader could come up with something more appealing. Hope, others don't make the mistake I did. The only thing that took me throughout the movie was the hope of some real action as the movie suggested. People thought Batman vs Superman was bad, well, this one will sure make you thankful for the BvS.",
"28","2","Stupid, repetitive (two helicopters crashes, two of them crashed one after another? what the f...?) and lifeless. DC's version of Guardians of the Galaxy (should i mention that the "You messed with my friends" line is an almost exact copy of the "Nobody messes with my friends" scene from Guardians?) is awful. It sucks, because BvS Ultimate Cut is decent, that's the tone they should've done. It's all just a clusterfuck, i'm sure the movie was better before the reshoots, but guess what? exactly like FOX and Fant4stic, the studio got in the way and made an unwatchable movie that lacks structure and pacing. The third act is the worst thing on earth, as it contains pathetic fight scenes and manipulative "character moments", at least BvS, a movie which also has an awful third act, is never boring even at a three hour runtime. Don't watch this movie if you don't want your brain cells to die.",
"29","3","Not as good as watching someone play Super Mario 3-D World, which is exactly what happened when I watched Suicide Squad. I did not watch all of the movie, but I had someone at work who had watched all of this sh*t movie twice, tell me what happens. I feel like that qualifies me as having seen Suicide Squad. Also Harley Quinn's backstory came off as a little rapey. Like David Ayer could have just written the Harley Quinn character as always subconsciously attracted to the Joker, but instead he wrote it so it reads as though the Joker has Harley gang raped into submission. Why write it that way? How is that better? Oh yeah, directing sucks acting sucks movie was written for sh*t, Suicide Squad officially reviewed.",
"30","2","When I first saw the trailer, I was absolutely excited to watch it. I had started preferring dc to marvel again, I was obsessed with Suicide squad. However, when I finally watched it, I was shocked. It was one of the worst films I have ever seen. The pros of the film were the trailer, characters even the album. However, there were many cheesy parts such as when Harley Quinn (who was probably the best part of the film) put her shirt on and everyone watches her. Also, before Harley Quinn cuts the Enchantresses heart out (who was actually a very weak villain) she quoted, "you messed with my friends." I thought the cast choice was very good. Another disappointing thing was the Joker was not in a lot. I would've expected a Joker vs Suicide squad film where Harley Quinn would've betrayed the team to join Joker. Also, the fact Rick Flag (who I thought Joel Kinnaman portrayed very well) just killed off Slipknot was not entertaining or relevant. He could have offered a lot more, but it was a waste of Adam Beach's time. In the end, I do not recommend it.",
"31","1","Don't know exactly how to sum this up except that Ayer along with Snyder are going to be the death of any decent DCMU series. Wait, they are the death of the DCMU series. This one is worse than "Dawn Of Justice" (though I really liked that flick) in terms of pacing, direction, dialogue, characterization, and plot - what makes it different is the total miscasting of everyone except Marogot Robbie, who would be awesome if they made her less-sexualized and not white trash ICP looking. The only thing that was enjoyable was seeing Batman. Just a shame these rouges are one-dimensional juggalos he has to clean up after.",
"32","1","After 55 minutes i left cinema, this was unwatchable. You can watch 100s movies just like this. It is poor made superhero movie with bad jokes all over the movie.It was about 10+ superhero characters that were prisoners and later they were set free to help war against aliens.
After 1h I was so bored i had to leave cinema. This was some of the worst movies I have ever saw really. I was most annoyed because they tried to make some poor comedy between actions scenes. I can say that I only liked acting of Jared Leto.
Please don't ever make this kind of movies anymore. This was only time I left cineplexx ever in my life.",
"33","1","not trying to spoil the fun here people but I didn't get the hype....The first 45 minutes of this CGI overkill blockbuster is okay. We are introduced to the villains or heroes or whatever label you want to put on these sociopaths then it starts to wear out it's welcome. The characters are never fully developed. To me,it's just a game of who can one up each other with one liners and zingers. I didn't laugh. I did not find the humor in it's constant sarcasm and over the top plot. The Joker seemed to be on bath salts and Harley Quinn just wanted a Manwich meal (her libido was on hyperdrive) No movie needs to be over two hours and the ending credits I'd have to say was the best part of the film. Sorry, I'm not a sheep.",
"34","1","Fair warning: DO NOT SEE SUICIDE SQUAD!!! It's a waste of time and money and they don't deserve anymore than what they've already received. There has been a lot of curiosity of what Jared Leto's portrayal of The Joker would be, and I must tell you that it is without a doubt the worst Joker portrayal of all time. He is only in the movie for a brief amount of time and thank god because every second he was on that screen was pure and utter agony. He technically played a character called The Joker but what i saw was in no shape or form The Joker. Will smith doesn't play dead shot, he plays will smith. Harley Quinn hardly even speaks like Harley Quinn. If your looking for a bright spot in this movie, don't worry, there isn't one. This movie encapsulates everything that's wrong with studio films nowadays. Cater to the young audience who isn't even a fan of the source material. This movie was made to sell Halloween costumes and merchandise. That is all. Try again DC, cause Marvel is kicking your ass.",
"35","1","When I saw the first trailer for this movie, I loved it so much that it made me want to go see it opening night. I can't believe I waited a whole year for this stupid movie.

"36","2","This movie was a mess it's hard for me to say anything positive about it,it had OK cinematography and pacing the effects were OK but it still wasn't good.It tried to embrace the fact that it was a comic book movie but just made a weird jumbled tone of serious and comical.They ruined Harley Quinn's backstory which could've been a movie on its own,speaking of which it suffers from the same thing as batman v superman it tried the shove to much crap in which made it incredibly on focused. The characters were boring and clich√©d and some of them completely useless,like killer croc doing nothing but swimming in the climax and "the man that can climb anything" dying.This movie was overall unpleasant to sit through.",
"37","1","The storyline was slow, and the whole movie was built for the 10 years old children to understand whats happening. It was filled with clich√©s and was not creative at all. I was so disappointed after watching this. I watched this with my friends and they are on the same opinion. The worst Batman / Superman movie ever I think. Ben Affleck was not a good choice for Batman because he is not "blue blooded" enough and was not able to act like them.
Spoiler alert! Why did they need Wonderwoman? She was really unnecessary. (Only for the Hype maybe?!) :/ :/ :/ :/ PS.: Why they did not ask for David Mazouz to play in the first part?",
"38","1","I wanted to love this movie, it had potential to be a great superhero film but it was pretty God awful. The plot was confusing, the cgi was bad, Doomsday appeared WAY TOO EARLY and Superman DIES in his second appearance. And the casting was bad. I mean Jesse Einsberg as Lex Luther? The good things about this was the acting, it was pretty well. Wonder Woman was also AWESOME but overall this is a very poor movie. Save your money for Captain America Civil War instead because it will unfortunately be a lot better than this.
Don't bother seeing this unless your a fan of DC because there is a lot of eye candy and Easter eggs.",
"39","1","Not even worth a review. There really is no spoiler alert outide of what you can see in a trailer, but just in case...
Batman was horribly presented, and so was every other character. The plot was just ridiculous and so was the integration of both villains and hero's. This movie should have never been made with so much extra junk. from wonderwoman, to lex luthor, to the made up villain in this movie they call doomsday (the creation of him in a complete joke). also, what a horrible character to play lex luther. This movie is complete crap. Batman does not use guns, and he does not brand people. Superman could crush the bat suit in this movie.There is nothing to imply that he could not. It's not a special metal. Laslty, the kryptonite spear. Batman literally drops it for anyone to pick up and realizes it half way through the climax in the ending. Louis lane in some freak accident managed to find it, and give it to them. The plot in this story is just the absolute worst in any comic book movie so far. More so than tobey maguire's spiderman, and definitely more so than the ongoing catastrophe they are calling the X-men.",
"40","1","Zack Snyder is the worst director for Superman, he clearly does not understand the character or maybe he does but he has a hidden hate for the character. First of all this is a Batman Movie having a guest appearance of Superman which is also Batman punching bag in fact even Batman left Superman with a scare so maybe the title would have been Scarface Superman. Now going to the movie it has like 80% of blah blah blah scenes which are extremely boring, 0 humor which I think is one of the greatest things Marvel did in their avengers movies, and for the fighting scenes they are also the worst, Dommsday? it looks like the cave troll from Lord of the Rings!!!! Why you have to do that? You have already a doomsday in the comics! why change it? Lex Luthor Zack Snyder had Bryan Cranston, and he hired this Jesse guy???? WHY!!!! and they are paying millions to Zack Snyder, even a 10 year old child would have better ideas, and yes maybe the box office will be huge for this first film as we wanted to see a good movie and we gave it the benefit of the doubt, but after we were literally robbed from our money by a movie that pretended to be a real competitor to the avengers we got a fiasco, will never watch any other film of DC comics unless they change Zack the OVERPAID Snyder!!!! Don't WATCH the movie wait until is in HBO",
"41","1","You don't even need to watch the movie, you can just watch all the trailers and there is all. Nothing surprised, and nothing shines(except wonder woman). If you want the batman to kill somebody, you'd better do some explanation ahead.(the robin suit does give a reason but I just can't feel the emotion! I know he's desperate, i know he's changed, but i just can't feel what he feels from the movie, that's the problem. They want the batman to be dark, but he's not dark from the movie, he's just too normal) This movie shouldn't be the second in the cinema universe, if it's the fourth or fifth movie that should be much better. As a second movie and the one to start a universe, this is so bad.",
"42","1","Spoilers below Clearly this film was just an attempt to make money by having superman and batman in the same film and they didn't even bother to add a plot to the story and just throw each other through buildings. I think everyone knew this film was doomed from the start, for me the worst part of the movie was Jesse eisenberg as lex luthor,the plot of lex was bad enough never mind with having to watch Jesse who is an awful actor ruin One of the greatest villains. I don't think they could of got a worse actor to play lex. watched 2hours of building up to the batman vs superman fight which the film was meant to be about ended within 10 minutes because they have the same mothers name. I'm guessing this film was made for children because no one over the age of 10 should be happy watching this abomination. Just like man of steel there is a city destroying battle yet Lois lane is in the middle of the destruction crying about superman. 2 and a half hours of 30 second scenes and I can't even remember a lot of the story as it was that boring? I feel sorry for anyone over the age of ten rating this film amazing or even average as this film was a train wreck and there is nothing positive in this lazy written story",
"43","3","The batman vs superman concept was always a dumb idea... in comics, in conversation, but especially in this movie. 
The movie starts out in a silly situation... (no spoilers here) and just progresses to get less and less interesting. 
It's not that Affleck is the worst batman since joel schumacher decided to put nipples on the batsuits... even though he is.
It's not that the guy playing superman somehow has no charisma at all. 
Gal Gadot could have been OK with a better script but it's hard to tell since the character is kind of flat. 
Save your time. Watch something (anything) else.",
"44","1","If you are just looking for a digital special effects show, buy a ticket and enjoy your popcorn and coke! there are a few novel digital effects there but do not ask for a rational story. Batman is manipulated against superman by a mad scientist in seconds and suddenly becomes Superman companion in less than seconds! The mad scientist (the worst artist for this role) makes a fight which it simply does not make sense. Why he does this? what does he want? NO answer! weak links and irrational reasons. It seems that Nolan got surprised by a new idea and made up the story over a night with no editing! Batman is used to be known as a fair and rational person. Why he suddenly decide to act as a criminal and fight back the BAD guys by marking them?? Why he does not use his super artificial intelligent system to check the SCIENTIST background? why superman can hear his girlfriend scream from the Arctic but he can not hear his mum????? Whole the movie reminds you a teenage comic. Actually, not a 2016-teenager, but a 1916-one! As even my 10-year-old son did not buy it and rate it awful!",
"45","1","I admit it. I am old school. Grew up reading DC comics. Know the canon and backstory. Enjoyed the campy cartoons and "NA na na na na na na BAT-MAN." This IS NOT BATMAN. This is NOT SUPERMAN. They're not good enough to bear those names. Some greedy (expletive deleted) slapped these names on their gawful ideas and fed the mess to the public. If you paid to see this, you're to blame. As long as you pay, they'll keep it up. Harrumph. I'd give it a second star if they renamed the characters, and stopped abusing my memories of the golden age of comics. Come to think of it, Nite Owl would have made a better "Batman" than this Batman... and a decent Clark Kent, too. (No, I wouldn't stretch it to cover Superman.)",
"46","2","The only reason I didn't give it a 1 (or Zero, if it were allowed) is that Ben Affleck is a pretty good Bruce Wayne. The plot is convoluted and illogical. The battle takes place in downtown Gotham, and Superman should have figured out from the last throw down that civilians are in danger. Jessie Eisenberg is a ridiculous Lex Luthor - he seems to be trying to channel Mark Hamill's Joker, both in mannerisms and voice. The various cameos of other DC characters were distracting, but I suppose were needed to set the stage for 'Justice League'
Very disappointing overall. This might be the end of the DC cinematic universe.",
"47","1","a horrible movie contains too many explosions, poor plots and no story telling at all. All actions scenes are somewhat well-made but the lack of understanding it makes them boring, I wanted to get out of the theater right in the middle of this movie. Cringe acting, way too "dark" (literally dark) too see, sometimes i don't even know what i'm looking at because 90% of screen is black.This film with the terrible plots, dialogues completely ruined the character Batman, it destroyed what Christopher Nolan built in years for just an hour. I came with excitement, but I wanted my ticket back right after I walked out of the cinema.",
"48","2","Come on how bad can a movie even be. Let's work along side with each other at the start and then fall out for the next 2 hours and 25 minutes and then the finally 5 minutes are quite sad. But I would hardly believe that it is true. Like Batman mask is so weird he looks like a robot with the blue eyes and plus he has no emotion. Good news. If you like Batman and Superman--they are both in this movie. Bad news. You're not going to recognize either one of them--unless you already saw Batman as a psychotic Donald Trump, and Superman as a whiny emo loser. Just watched this flop. This isn't a superhero movie. This is a sub-mediocre action movie with superheroes thrown in to make it seem interesting and milk the trend. Great for 13 year old edge lords. Go see if you're a latent Juggalo.",
"49","2","Curt Swan's SUPERMAN was an inspiration to the young Poe426; as was the BATMAN of the same period. To see how the Mighty have fallen is akin to attending the Final Moments of a Loved One (which I've done). Superman suffers not one but TWO brutal cgi beatdowns in BATMAN VS SUPERMAN, and he suffers them back to back; no wonder "The Man Of Steel" succumbs. Historically (or hysterically), both beatings were the kind of lamebrained gimmicks comic book publishers/editors come up with to try to breathe life into what they believe are foundering titles (like "variant" covers or tin foil covers, etc.), and now they've transposed same to The Big Screen. It is what it is, and the movie speaks (ever so poorly) for itself.",
"50","1","Show is great, but it's the censored version on Amazon Prime.
Most episodes are 4-6min shorter because of all the censoring. Not sure why they would, but it's pretty lame to do so and not make it clearly stated. This show deserves to be seen as the creators intended it, I will get the the rest of the seasons elsewhere.",
"51","2","This is a short review, but this movie wasn't great. the fight scenes where flashy and hard to follow, the plot was dumb, and the lex luthor character was more joker than lex luthor. The only reason this has two stars, was because of doomsday. he was cool, and earned this movie both of those stars alone. all in all, don't watch this movie. go see what they are trying to rip off, avengers civil war.",
"52","1","Everything that could go wrong goes wrong in this movie. From screenplay to direction , this movie disappoints in acting , graphics , lightening well in every thing , Superman disappoints me , lex luthor may make u laugh , and the ultimate showdown, which we had in our minds, goes terribly wrong....",
"53","3","And that is about the best thing that can be said, about this Remake. OK, the actors are good looking too, but it's up to you to decide if you want to honor the casting people. And they just did more or less, what the original did. Took some "hot" names and put them together in a movie. It's not the fault of the actors though, that the movie could not live up to the original (which did not age well itself).
Even though you sort of get a new villain (sort of, "instead" of Russia) and one that is personified, it doesn't really touch you. The plot just doesn't fly. There are more holes here than in swiss cheese. It tries hard to explain things, which often times makes them even more ridiculous. Even the original knew better than that. Of course the action is updated as mentioned above, but is that enough for the lack of passion and the obnoxious use of the "piece symbol" (with fingers)? You have to answer that one yourself. Characters are not consistent and overall it's too "smooth" for its own good",
